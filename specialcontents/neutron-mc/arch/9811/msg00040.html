Hi there,

Thanks for your speedy reply.

&gt; I do (the system sends me an e-mail). I did see your new address being
&gt; added to the list, but I never saw the old one being removed, and in
&gt; fact pha70@cc.keele.ac.uk is still on the list. Apparently there is some
&gt; list problem?
&gt; 

Yes, perhaps. I checked on the Keele computer and the mail system has sent
a message to my account that it is unable to deliver a message to
majordomo@neutron.risoe.dk but will keep trying for 5 days. 



&gt; &gt; The ALLOCA problem.
&gt; Ok, I fixed (I hope) the alloca problem. Now mcstas should no longer use
&gt; the alloca() function at all. I just checked, and mcstas now compiles on
&gt; our HP box using the HP compiler (we normally use gcc).
&gt; 

Excellent I'll e-mail my man and tell him to download the beta version. I'll
check with him if he tried the IBM. Looks good though, you've now covered
pretty well all the major platforms, DEC, HP, IBM (I haven't heard, so
no news is good news), Linux (in various versions) and Win95 with Visual C and
Drew has it for the Borland C++ compiler.


&gt; I already fixed the strcasecmp/stricmp problem in my sources. For
&gt; Windows (32 bit) a few other minor details needs fixing, see the list
&gt; archive for details. My current sources compile cleanly in Visual C (it
&gt; is necessary to define the C preprocessor macro "WIN32").
&gt; 
&gt; In the end quite a few files have small changes, so rather than sending
&gt; individual files I will build a beta of "McStas v1.01" and put it on the
&gt; web page later today.

I've downloaded a copy to my laptop and will give it a try tomorrow.

&gt; Great. The reason for the "./program" thing is that "." (the current
&gt; directory) is not included in the $PATH variable, probably for security
&gt; reasons. I think that is even in the manual :-).

Yes, looking in the manual was how I "worked it out", would have fooled me
otherwise.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Collimator + Energy monitor. Okay so a flat energy distribution from say 5meV
&gt; &gt; to 100meV. But it wasn't flat in the energy detector. Reason being, as Drew
&gt; &gt; explained to me, your source emits as a uniform velocity distribution ? In other
&gt; &gt; words you convert the low and high energy ranges to velocities and then use a
&gt; &gt; 0 t 1 random number generator in the range of velocities ? Velocity is a funny
&gt; 
&gt; Ouch! We fixed this in the Source_flat component, but missed it in the
&gt; Moderator component. I will fix this and include it in the McStas beta.
&gt; 

We hope to put McStas through it's paces next week. I have done a series of 
calculations for a new spectrometer design they're thinking about at KEK
using my program and Drew is going to check my results by repeating the 
calculations with McStas next week.

He sent a message to the mailing list about his Fermi chopper component, I don't
know if you saw it or not. His explanation was a little opaque, but I have seen
his computed results compared with results for the design of the MARI (spectrometer
at ISIS) Fermi chopper and they do compare very well. A Fermi chopper is an important
component for the ToF community, it is probably something, once you are happy with
his code, that you want as a standard component in your library. I am reasonably
happy with his code because.... for some reason it is jolly similar to my F90 code
for a Fermi chopper :)

Okay, it's late here in Japan, I'm off for some sleep, things look pretty good to
me, hope you're getting plenty of hits and e-mail sign-ups, I'm sure it will grow
with time,

cheers,

Mark
