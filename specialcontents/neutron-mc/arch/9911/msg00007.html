You know, already as an Alpha it's great, so ...
<br>for instance it is now possible to install transparently instrument
simulations easy to use (for visitors) on real instruments.
<br>Concerning the crystal samples, Thomas and I are now thinking about
some components describing inelastic, incoherent, elastic scattering (for
phonons, magnons, Bragg...).
<br>How far are you now on this way ?
<p>Cheers. EF.

<p>> I've installed the version 1.17A of McStas.
<p>Great! I realize that I may have forgotten to warn you that this is
<br>again an ALPHA version, meaning that it may be unstable, etc. Your
<br>comments on problems are very useful, I will fix the problems you
<br>mention in the upcoming v1.2 proper release.
<p>> Problems :
<br>> 1-Definition of components change sometimes (for instance Guide2).
The
<p>Yes, I was aware of this but it is good to be reminded! I will fix this,
<br>probably by renaming the new Guide component to something else. For
now,
<br>just delete it or copy the one from the unofficial download page on
top.
<p>I actually try very hard to be 100% backward compatible in new versions,
<br>so if you saw any more problems than the Guide2 component you mentioned,
<br>please let me know.
<p>Anyway, my plan is to implement optional parameters in components,
<br>ie. parameters that have default values if the user does not specify
<br>them. This would make it easier to extend components while maintaining
<br>backwards compatibility.
<p>> 2- Some help sections in components have disappeared since previous
<br>> versions
<br>>
<br>> Undocumented :
<br>> Channeled_guide.comp
<br>> DivPos_monitor.comp
<br>[...]
<p>Yes, the missing documentation is the main thing that I need to finish
<br>before I can release the next version.
<p>> 3- The MCGui seems to work ok&nbsp; My comments are : would it be
possible to
<br>> make a-Highlight syntaxing, such as in nedit or vim, with C based
<br>> template and MCSTAS macros added&nbsp; By the way, it is possible
for
<p>Of course, but it would probably be a lot of work.
<p>> instance to customize the 'Shell' menu of NEdit in order to execute
some
<br>> mcstas operations.
<p>Yes, I think this is a better way to proceed. Anyway, there should be
no
<br>problem using another editor instead of the really stupid one in
<br>mcgui. Mcgui will automatically recompile if the instrument has changed
<br>on disk, independent of what is in the internal editor.
<p>> Perhaps a good option would be to optionally use the EDITOR variable,
<br>> and use the mcgui one as default. mcgui could then check for changes
in
<p>Yes, this is a good idea. The mcgui editor was only added because it
<br>could be done in two lines of code with Perl/Tk, I am not sure it is
<br>really a good idea. For serious use one would definitely use a better
<br>editor.
<p>> file and warn if unsaved before compiling.
<p>> b- I guess you intend to add some copy/paste and search/replace features
<br>> sometimes... (with Unix mouse text mode right now). Ctrl-C, X and
V seem
<br>> to work ok.
<p>Yes, maybe.
<p>> 4- I've tried to obtain the HMI Vitess program. No way to compile
it on
<br>> my Mac PPC G3. And it appears quite monolythic (no way to create/modify
<br>> components or instrument structure)
<p>Ah! I also tried it, and I agree with your impression. Apparently they
<br>are not willing to let anyone have their source code, which is in my
<br>opinion a very serious limitation. And also a great pity, since some
of
<br>their components seem to have received a lot of effort. Overall, VITESS
<br>appears to be still a bit behind programs like McStas, MCLIB, and SHADOW.
<p>> 5- We've planed a Monte-Carlo unofficial workshop on

<br>>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
January 21th 2000.
<br>>
<br>> You're invited of course. The aim is to gather efforts concerning
MC
<br>> simulations (i.e. Shadow, Vitess, McStas, Restrax, ...) even if I
think
<br>> that some dev team won't be keen on cooperating.
<p>Ok, thanks for the notice, I will make a note in my calendar. Hopefully
<br>I can participate, it sounds quite interesting. Also, I think (=hope)
<br>that McStas v1.2 will have been released by then.
<p>> For reflectometers, handling neutron interferences is not straight
<br>> forward yet (need to propagate the neutron phase also)
<br>> For SpinEcho, we should get further in designing magnetic components...
<p>Yes, this is an interesting direction of development, with entirely
new
<br>challenges. It is very good that effort is being spent on this at the
<br>ILL, I am not aware of any previous major effort on spin in Monte Carlo.
<p>> Also we need to create some efficient samples for testing instruments.
<br>> Powder is ok, need crystals...
<p>I am currently working with some other people at Risoe on very realistic
<br>single-crystal samples (many reflections with individual structure
<br>factors, multiple scattering, mosaic, ...). And similarly for
<br>powder. Expect something good in a few months, maybe even at the ILL
<br>Workshop (no promises though!).
<p>> 6- After discussion, the 'chiefs' think it's better to have a specific
<br>> ILL page for instruments, components, and documentation. Links would
<br>> reach the Risoe site.
<p>Ok. In any case, in the future I will be more quick to put contributed
<br>components on the web page, especially if it just involves a link to
the
<br>ILL pages.
<p>Thanks for the comments on the new McStas version, I will fix things
<br>before the official release.
