<h1>McStas FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions with answers</h1>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Information</span><br>
</h2>
<h3>Where can I get information about McStas?</h3>
A good source of information is the McStas Web page, at <a href="http://www.mcstas.org/"> <code>http://www.mcstas.org/</code></a>
<h3>Where can I ask questions about McStas?</h3>
Questions about McStas should be sent to the neutron/Monte Carlo
mailing list. See<a href="http://neutron.risoe.dk/list/"><code></code></a>
<a href="http://www.mcstas.org/list/">http://www.mcstas.org/list/</a>
for details.
<h3>Are there any bugs in McStas?</h3>
A list of known bugs can be found at <a href="http://www.mcstas.org/documentation/problems/">http://www.mcstas.org/documentation/problems/</a>.
Also have a look at out <small><b><a href="http://www.mcstas.org/McZilla/" class="menu">bug tracking system</a><span class="menu">.</span></b></small>
<h2 style="text-align: center; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Installation -
configuration</h2>
<h3>The installation of McStas seems rather complex. How should I
proceed ?</h3>
Have a look at the <a href="/download/install">Install</a> page. We provide installers for most systems. A manual installation can be done using the procedure indicated in our <a href="/svn/svn.html">SVN</a> page.<br>
If you really can not manage, the <a href="/ubuntu/">McStas
LiveDVD</a> provides a fully functional system for all Intel/AMD based
systems, without touching your local machine, but with full computing
efficiency.<br>
<h3>The installation of McStas cannot find the right Perl interpreter.
What can I do?</h3>
See the <a href="/download/install">installation
instructions</a><a href="INSTALL"><code></code></a> and try out the Python-chaco, Python-matplotlib, Gnuplot or Matlab/iFit plotters.<br>
<h2 style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); text-align: center;">Using McStas</h2>
<h3>How do I make the graphical user interface use another C compiler?</h3>
It is possible to define the MCSTAS_CC and MCSTAS_CFLAGS
environement variables to override the default configuration, or to
simply set it in the mcgui <span style="font-style: italic;">Preferences.<br>
</span>
<pre>export MCSTAS_CC=/usr/opt/ansic/cc</pre>

<h3>I can not write bigger files than 2Gb with McStas, is there a
workaround?</h3>
First, please consider if you <strong>really</strong> need such big
files. If you do, McStas can perfectly well write bigger files than 2Gb
if you make sure that your MCSTAS_CFLAGS
contains proper c-compiler defines to allow this. On x86 Linux with
gcc, relevant values are
<pre>-D_LARGEFILE_SOURCE -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64<br></pre>You may also 
prefer the NeXus format (HDF5 based) that McStas can generate. This 
format can support very large data files. Look at the <a href="file:///download/install">Install</a> page
<h3>I think McStas gives the wrong number of neutrons in the detector
in my simulation. What is wrong?</h3>
The number of neutrons histories that reach the detector in a McStas
simulation is usually not very meaningful. McStas uses weighted
neutrons
extensively (see <a href="/manual">the manual</a> for details) and
different neutrons may carry widely different weights. Always use the
intensity in detectors when analyzing simulation data.<br>
<h3>Can McStas use clusters and Grids ?</h3>
Yes, install MPICH or OpenMPI, and select MPI or Grid when running the simulation from the GUI.<br>
<h3>Can McStas import files from other neutron MC packages ?</h3>
Yes, McStas can read files generated by Vitess, MCNP/MCNPX, and
Tripoli. Other importers are easy to write. Just ask us. <br>
<h3>What type of data can McStas generate ?</h3>
McStas usually generates histograms (tallies) as formatted (easy to
read) text files. Such text files may be read by the McStas internal
plotter using PGPLOT, Python/matplotlib, Python/chaco, iFit/Matlab, and Gnuplot.<br>
Event files may be
generated for MCNP/MCNPX, Vitess and Tripoli. McStas has also its own
event file format, which can be used to split a simulation into pieces
(see the User Manual with the <span style="font-style: italic;">Virtual_input/output</span>
component).<br>
<h3>Is there a way to interact with a running simulation ?</h3>
Yes, it is possible to make the simulation report and save results
during the simulation. The on-line plotting tool <span style="font-style: italic;">mcdaemon</span> may then plot the results
as they come, in the course of the computation (see the <span style="font-style: italic;">Progress_bar</span> component). On
Unix/Linux/MacOSX systems (excet when running with MPI and grids), one
may additionally send USR1 and USR2 signals to the simulation (refer to
the User Manual).<br>
