<h1>Scatter-log bundle</h1>
This bundle contains the four special components required for running the scatter_logger framework within McStas and two example instruments which uses it:
<p>Caveat emptor: The framework should be considered <i>experimental</i> so far, but has been tested to work with a 2.0 series McStas on Linux. MPI is untested, but should work since we rely on regular monitors that work. Neutron ids will _not_ be unique, however.  

<p>Comments, critique, bug reports, praise (should there be any) is as always welcome

<p>Happy simulating
