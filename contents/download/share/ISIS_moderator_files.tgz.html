<h1>ISIS moderator files</h1>
<p>Unfortunately the ISIS Monte Carlo simulation website has disappeared from the web. For the convenience of McStas users, the input files for ISIS_moderator.comp are provided here.
<p>The moderator files can be placed in the work directory from where you run your simulation or centrally in the $MCSTAS/contrib/ISIS_tables
