<p>Hi Peter

<p>We (Richard Heenan and I) have a component that we use for the LoKI benders (attached) which was a modification of the Pol_bender component to allow us to have it bending downwards/upwards and still have functional gravity. This allows for different reflectivities and is truly curved as well as giving a curved representation in the model. 

<p>You can find our LoKI model on bitbucket (link below) if you want to see how we use it.
