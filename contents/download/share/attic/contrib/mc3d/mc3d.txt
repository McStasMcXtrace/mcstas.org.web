MC2D & MC3D - replacements for the McStas display GUI's

I designed these programs to run on windows & unix platforms.
May even be possible to port to a mac given enough effort.

MC2D & MC3D were built around the OpenGL engine and use the
GLUT and GLUI libraries to implement a GUI interface.  On
unix you probably have GLUT installed, if not the source
file is included here and a link it given to the newest
version.  On windows you should copy the compiled dlls for
GLUT.  On windows I have used the free Borland compiler
though Visual C++ will probably also work.  You will have
to go the Borland (Inprise) site to download their compiler
if you want to use it.

   Source files for GLUT, needed for unix, and taken from:

glut-3.7.2-dlls.zip  106,110
   Precompiled dlls for GLUT, needed for windows, and taken from:
   http://www.xmission.com/~nate/glut.html

glui_v2_beta.zip  327,381
   Source files for GLUI, needed by everyone, and taken from:
   http://www.cs.unc.edu/~rademach/glui/#beta_v2

borland_glui.zip  30,294
   How to compile GLUI using the Borland compiler for windows.
   Even if you are going to use another windows compiler you
   should download this and look at the readme.txt file.

mc3d_components.zip  91,564
   The standard components of McStas v1.4 editted for use by
   MC3D.  Also contains a new prismas2.instr to be used as an
   example.  Copy these files over the standard ones (backup
   the old ones first)

mc3d.zip  30,403
   Source code for MC3D & MC2D.
   I include a MAKE.BAT to compile the program on windows using
   the Borland compiler, and a makefile that I used on our SGI
   O2 machine.

mc3d_exes.zip 228,237
   Precompiled versions of MC3D & MC2D for windows.
   Either download mc3d_components.zip and mc3d.zip (to look at
   the readme.txt file in it) to compile your own simulations,
   or download demo_exes.zip to view the results for the
   example prisma2 simulation.

demo_exes.zip 65,446
   Precompiled version of (editted) prisma2 for windows.
   Use run.bat to create prisma2 output files.
   Use commands "mc3d trace.out" and "mc2d" to display results.
