<H1>SEMSANS model for McStas by Morten Sales</H1>
This is a short guide on how to simulate a Spin-Echo Modulated Small Angle Neutron Scattering instrument (SEMSANS) using McStas and

<p>components:
<ul>
  <li>Analyser_ideal.comp
  <li>Pol_pi_2_rotator.comp
  <li>Pol_triafield.comp
</ul>

<p>and instrument file:
<ul>
  <li>SEMSANS_instrument.instr
</ul>
 

<p>The Analyser_ideal component is written by Erik Knudsen and works as an (Unphysical) ideal analyser of neutron spin direction.
<p>The Pol_pi_2_rotator component is also written by Erik Knudsen and rotates the neutron spin 90 degrees around a given vector. It is an ideal unphysical version of a V-coil.
<p>The Pol_triafield is witten by Morten Sales and is an ideal unphysical triangular field. The amount of precession a neutron spin would experience passing through the field is calculated and applied. More information can be found in the code for the component.

<p>The SEMSANS_instrument is the instrument file for the SEMSANS instrument.
It works by having a 
<ul>
  <li>source, 
  <li>double-chopper, 
  <li>polariser, 
  <li>slit, 
  <li>2 V-coils, 
  <li>1st precessionfield (called guidefield), 
  <li>triangular field (with precessionfield included), 
  <li>2nd precessionfield, 
  <li>2 V-coils, 
  <li>3rd precessionfield, 
  <li>triangular field, 
  <li>4th precessionfield (with precessionfield included), 
  <li>2 V-coils, 
  <li>slit, 
  <li>analyser, 
  <li>choice of single slit, double slit or grating,
  <li>Time of Flight (TOF) detector.
</ul>
(More information can be found in the code of the instrument file)

<p>The position of the 2 V-coils in the middle responsible for the 180 degree spin flip can be scanned with the parameter flippos.
<br>The start orientation of the neutron spin is controlled with the parameter FLIP where 1 is ‘down’ and -1 is up’. This parameter works in the first V-coil.

<p>After the simulation where flippos has been scanned for both FLIP 1 and -1, the output from the TOF detector can be combined into as e.g. a 2D colorplot of Polarisation signal vs TOF (wavelength) and flippos.
