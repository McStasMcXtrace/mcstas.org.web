<h1>Reproducing TDR and "Pancake" ESS brilliances using McStas</h1>

<p>The <a href="Reproducing_ESS_TDR_and_pancake_brillances_with_McStas.pdf">PDF document</a> is meant to give further clarity on the available
ESS source parameterisations for use with McStas. We shall only
consider the TDR and pancake type brilliances, as these are ESS
baseline quantities or considered important milestones. The "optimised
thermal" moderator configuration is currently not implemented in
McStas, but will become available with McStas 2.2 planned for release
during the spring of 2015.

<p>A new component called ESS_moderator.comp was distributed with McStas 2.1 and also exists for use with 2.0 and 1.12c through the archive
