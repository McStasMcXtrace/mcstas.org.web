<p>This package contains:
<ol>
  <li>Updated ESS source components for McStas 1.12c and 2.0 with
  <ul>
    <li> Cold and thermal moderators
    <li> Cylindrical cold source geometry
    <li> Flat thermal wing geometry
    <li> Geometry close to that from MCNPX
    <li> 2012 cold brightness
    <li> A much easier-to-use definition of geometry, allowing to
    specify the instrument position within a 60-degree sector
    <li> A couple of bug fixes
  </ul>
  <li>Updated Brilliance_monitor.comp for McStas 1.12c and 2.0
  <li>ESS_moderator_long_2001.comp for McStas 1.12c (same as included in McStas 2.0)
  <li>Test instruments set up for estimating the (cold) source brilliance 
  of ESS in 2012 and 2001 versions
  <li>PDF plots of average and peak brilliance as produced by the new McStas 
  source, overlayed on the officialcurve from ESS target division and 
  the corresponding curve from VitESS.
</ol>
We hope to soon release McStas either a 2.0a or 2.1 which will include 
these as well as other improvements.
