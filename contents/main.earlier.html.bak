<h2>February 27th, 2020: McStas 3.0beta bugfixes etc</h2>
<ul>
  <li>As we move along with the development on the mcstas-3.0 branch, you may find patched
  versions of components in the Updates folder found next to the
  distribution binaries at <a
  href="http://download.mcstas.org/mcstas-3.0beta/">http://download.mcstas.org/mcstas-3.0beta/</a>.
  <li>A first bug with fix: Unfortunately, a buggy <a
  href="https://github.com/McStasMcXtrace/McCode/commit/86dc24423083dc980ad09c82d74866d9d826d34d">last-minute
  change</a> to the PowderN component before mcstas-3.0beta was built introduced an
  error which makes it produce 0 scattered intensity. Please find
  an improved version in <a
  href="http://download.mcstas.org/mcstas-3.0beta/Updates">the
  above-mentioned Updates folder</a>. Further bugfixes to this
  component are expected since the component
  produces scattering but has certain edge-case issues on GPU, especially at high ncount rates.
  <li>At any time, know bugs will be listed as issues on GitHub <a
  href="https://github.com/McStasMcXtrace/McCode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Amcstas-3.0beta">marked
  with the label of "mcstas-3.0beta"</a>
  <li>Please do submit issues to GitHub as you find them: This will
  help in the process toward a stable, official 3.0 release!

<h2>February 25th, 2020: McStas 3.0beta technology preview available!</h2>
<p>Dear all,
<p>A technology preview for the forthcoming McStas 3.x series is now
available for testing!

<p>Main highlights of the release are:
<ul>
  <li>New code-generation scheme based on functions instead of #defines
  <li>Much improved compilation-times, the code is better suited for modern compilers
  <li>In most cases a speed-up of order 20% on CPU
  <li>Limited, experimental support for OpenACC acceleration on NVIDIA GPU's
  <li>Speedups measured using top-notch NVIDIA V100 datacenter cards are in the range of 10-600 with respect to a single-core CPU
  <li>In essence, you will need a Linux machine with an NVIDIA card and
  the PGI compiler to make use of the GPU-support
</ul>
<p>For more details and instructions, please refer to <a
href="https://github.com/McStasMcXtrace/McCode/wiki/McStas-3.0beta-technology-preview-release-notes">this
document on our Wiki</a>
<p>Thanks to:

  <li>Thanks to all members of the <a href="https://github.com/McStasMcXtrace/McCode/wiki/McStas-McXtrace-team">joint McStas-McXtrace team</a>, you guys ROCK!
  <li>Thanks to Guido Juckeland (HZDR,DE) and Sebastian Alfthan (CSC,FI) who were behind the GPU Hackathons we participated in
  <li>Thanks to our NVIDIA mentors Vishal Metha, Christian Hundt and Alexey Romanenko

  </ul>
 
  <li>Libraries:
  <ul>

    <li>Updated version of the NXS lib from Mirko Boin HZB.
  </ul>

  <li>Components:
  <ul>
    <li>Updated Union library from Mads Bertelsen, ESS DMSC including
    <ul>
      <li>New geometries, mesh (for stl file input in Union setups) and cone (e.g. relevant for describing anvils
      in pressure cells.
      <li>New AF_HB_1D_process for modelling 1D antiferromagnetic
      Heisenberg chains and PhononSimple_process for modelling
      single-branchg acoustic phonons ala Phonon_simple
    </ul>
    <li>New SINE2020-developed Union physics processes from Victor Laliena, Uni Zaragoza: Texture_process.comp
    and IncoherentPhonon_process.comp. See <a href="https://doi.org/10.3233/JNR-190117">DOI:10.3233/JNR-190117</a>.
    <li>Shieldinglogger-components from Rodion Kolevatov, IFE for
    estimating gamma-production in guides:
    <ul>
      <li>Contributions Dose_calculator and Shielding_calculator
      <li>Patched versions of optics-components: Elliptic_guide_gravity_shieldinglogger, Guide_channeled_shieldinglogger,
     Guide_curved_shieldinglogger, Guide_gravity_shieldinglogger, Guide_shieldinglogger
      <li>Components patched / derived from the "scatterlogger"
  framework to model Ni and Ti layers seperately:
  Shielding_log_iterator_Ni_new, Shielding_log_iterator_Ti_new,
  Shielding_log_iterator_stop, Shielding_log_iterator_total,
      Shielding_logger.comp, Shielding_logger_stop.comp.
      <li>See <a
  href="https://doi.org/10.3233/JNR-190123">DOI:10.3233/JNR-190123</a>,
  <a
  href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nima.2018.12.069">DOI:10.1016/j.nima.2018.12.069</a>
  and <a href="https://doi.org/10.3233/JNR-180088">DOI:10.3233/JNR-180088</a>.
      <li>Please note that the included Shielding- and Dose- calculators will only give sensible for guides with
     borosilicate glass substrate. If the substrate is, e.g. copper, the dose rates from neutrons transmitted 
     through the coating and captured in the substrate will overshoot the coating contribution significantly, 
     so that shielding has to be enforced by few tens of centimeters of concrete. 
    </ul>
    <li>Guide_anyshape_r additions from Peter Link MLZ. Allows
  describing geometry in OFF format with reflectivity "per" face. Test
  instrument is Test_guides which has been updated to include this
    modified component.
    <li>Vertical_Bender from Andrew Jackson ESS and Richard Heenan STFC. Allows modelling a multi-channel bender
    that curves vertically down.
    <li>SANS_spheres2 by Peter Willendrup, derived from Henrich Frilinghaus' SANS_benchmark2. More realistic cross-section
    calculations than from e.g. Sans_spheres. templateSANS2.instr is the related test instrument.
    <li>Updated version of Sample_nxs from Mirko Boin HZB.
    <li>Single_magnetic_crystal.comp is an experimental magnetic csingle crystal model. Its operational model is based 
    on that of Single_crystal.comp but supports SF and NSF magnetic scattering. The present model only supports
    the SF-NSF paradigm along a given reference vector.  
    <li>PSD_monitor_4PI_spin.comp is a version of PSD_monitor_4PI but with separate SF- and NSF-channels
  </ul>
  <li>Instruments:
  <ul>
    <li>Union_test_texture.instr demonstrates use of Texture_process.comp by Victor Laliena. To be used with datafile
   "coef_Four_L2.txt" found in the installation data-folder. This datafile contains texture information on Zr alloys
    derived <a
  href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnucmat.2018.08.003">from DOI:10.1016/j.jnucmat.2018.08.003</a>.
    <li>Union_IncoherentPhonon_test.instr demonstrates use of IncoherentPhonon_process.comp by Victor Laliena. To be used
   with datafile "dos_meV.txt" found in the installation data-folder.
    <li>Union_test_mesh.instr demonstrates use of mesh geometry in Union
    <li>ESS_BIFROST_shielding.instr and PSI_Focus_shielding.instr, demonstration of Shielding_logger concept from
   Rodion Kolevatov
    <li>TasResoTest, triple-axis resolution test instrument from Tobias Weber ILL. Can be used with his new tool
   development mcresplot.py.
    <li>Tools_ONION, instrument to investigate q-resolution via
  Mantid, by Thomas Huegle, ORNL. See also <a
  href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nima.2019.162711">DOI:10.1016/j.nima.2019.162711</a> and the related python
  code available at our new <a
  href="https://github.com/McStasMcXtrace/McCode-contribution-support-docs/tree/master/McStas/2.6_Onion_tool_T_Huegle">"snippet"
  repository</a> that should eventually replace <a
  href="/download/share">the old "share" part of this webpage</a>.
    <li>templateSANS_MCPL, behaves like the normal templateSANS but dumps all events in an MCPL file.
    <li>MCPL-oriented tool-instruments by Peter Willendrup. See the CHANGES document for full detail.
    <li>SINE2020-developed McStas_Isotropic_Sqw, McStas_PowderN, McStas_Single_crystal by Erik Knudsen. They have
    MCPL input/output and are intended for easy use of McStas samples within SIMRES.
    <li>Test_guides has been modified to include Guide_anyshape_r from Peter Link MLZ.
    <li>templateSANS2 serves as test instrument for SANS_spheres2.
    <li>Test_single_magnetic_crystal.instr is a skeleton Laue camera
    which exemplfies use of Single_magnetic_crystal.comp
  </ul>

  <li>Datafiles:
  <ul>
    <li>Klaus Lieutenant from FZJ/Vitess has collected reflectitivy-data from SwissNeutronics, Mirrotron and S-DH, analysed
    these and fitted the "classical" McStas mirror-reflectivity profile to these. The resulting data have been placed
    in the data directory under the filenames of
    <ul>
      <li>SwissNeutronics_mirors_2020.txt
      <li>Mirrotron_mirors_2020.txt
      <li>S-DH_mirors_2020.txt.
    </ul>
    <li>The files are not to be used directly with reflecting components, but can instead be used as lookup-tables for
   relevant parameters in each case. I.e. for a mirror of nominal m-value m_nom, use m_real, R_0, W and alpha from the
    relevant table.
  </ul>
</ul> - Most other new datafiles are directly related to component- or instrument-additions and have been mentioned above.

<p>We hope you will enjoy this new release!!!
