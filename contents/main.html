highest intensity). The sample is at the center of the sphere with the

the effect of the non-symmetric geometry of the sample, causing lower intensity
directly above and to the side of the sample.<br clear="BOTH"></td><td><img src="/pics/McStas-25-years.png" width="250"  hspace="15" align="RIGHT"></td></tr></tbody></table>

<h2>January 8th, 2025: Monte Carlo Sattelite to ICNS2025</h2>
<p>Dear all,
<p>The <a href="https://icns2025.org">ICNS2025 conference</a> is taking place in Copenhagen and Lund this summer, and the abstract submission is closing <b>January 8th - TODAY</b>.


<p>Of special interest to McStas users:<br>
A satellite event is being planned for July 11th, arranged by Mads Bertelsen, ESS and Peter Willendrup DTU/ESS. 
We envision a one-day event with contributed talks on instrument simulation and its use, abstract submission will open soon:<br>

<h3><strong>Advanced computer simulations methods for neutron scattering instruments</strong></h3>

<p><i>Abstract:</i><br>
Neutron scattering relies heavily on computer simulations of neutron scattering instrumentation to optimize their performance. These simulation tools are also evolving to be more relevant for a running facility, aiding in both preparation and analysis for individual experiments. It is even becoming possible to make better decisions during experiments by running simulations in parallel.

<p>All the best and hope to see you this summer in Copenhagen,
<br>Peter Willendrup
