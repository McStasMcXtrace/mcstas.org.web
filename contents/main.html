the effect of the non-symmetric geometry of the sample, causing lower intensity

<h2>November 24th, 2021: McStas "ng" 3.1 released</h2>
<p>Dear all,

<p>A new release of McStas "next-generation", v. 3.1 has been built and is ready for download!

<p>Download and installation instructions are available via our <a href="https://github.com/McStasMcXtrace/McCode/tree/master/INSTALL-McStas-3.x">GitHub download pages</a>.

<p>Selected highligts from the release are listed below. The full list
of changes is also available at <a href="https://mcstas.org/CHANGES_McStas">https://mcstas.org/CHANGES_McStas</a>.

<ul>
  <li>Fixes of issues from last release:
  <ul>
    <li>A large number of issues from the earlier 3.0 were addressed, see the relevant GitHub issues for details:
    <li><a href="https://github.com/McStasMcXtrace/McCode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3Amcstas-3.0">https://github.com/McStasMcXtrace/McCode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3Amcstas-3.0</a>
    <li>Migration-docs and guides for transitioning between McStas 2.x and 3.x can be found on our GitHub-based <a href="https://github.com/McStasMcXtrace/McCode/wiki">Wiki</a>

  </ul>
  <li>Tools
  <ul>
    <li>mcgui allows definition of an "external editor", see the configuration menu.
    <li>On Linux we preconfigure for gedit (where we now also provide syntax-highlighting, on macOS
    and Windows we default to use the OS file-type settings, i.e. whatever you get by double-clicking
    an instr file.) Use ctrl/meta + shift + e to spawn the editor from mcgui.
  </ul>
  <li>Platforms:
  <ul>
    <li>We still support 64bit Windows 10/11 on Intel, all recent 64bit macOS including 11.x Big Sur and 12.x Monterey on
    both Intel and Apple Silicon/M1 processors. Debian-based distros on Intel and Arm, RPM-based distros on Intel.
    (RPMs are built on/for CentOS and Fedora, you may get varying
    milage elsewhere.)
  </ul>
</ul>
We hope you will enjoy this new release!!!

<h2>April 21st, 2021: McStas on the Apple M1 processor</h2>
<p>Dear all,
<p>The McStas team finally got access to a mac with the new Apple M1
processor and can now report some experience back:
<ul>
  <li>Installation and use of the McStas 2.7 and 3.0 app bundles work OK via Rosetta 2
  (i.e. Intel-emulation on M1)
  <li>You have to do a little hacking to run on the commandline,
  i.e. use the command:
  <pre>arch -x86_64 /usr/local/bin/mcstas-3.0-environment </pre>
  to start a full McStas 3.0 environment in emulation.
  <li>To simply always run such an env script via emulation, you may even replace the first #! command in the script by this:
  <pre>#!/usr/bin/arch -x86_64 /bin/bash</pre>
  <li>Performance-wise the processor looks very good, having tried a
  few MPI-based simulations that are all a factor of 2-6 faster than
  on the 2018 machine it is replacing.
  <li>Performance should be even better the moment we release a
  dedicated M1-native version of McStas, hopfully within the next few months.
</ul>

<h2>March 10th, 2021: Videos from Virtual McStas Seminar at MLZ</h2>
<p>Dear all,
<p>Mads Bertelsen and Peter Willendrup gave 3 talks at an MLZ Virtual
McStas Seminar last week, arranged by Peter Link MLZ. The videos are
available on YouTube:
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQHiLHeI4Tk">McStas 3.0 -
GPU support in McStas (Peter Willendrup)</a>
<br><strong>Abstract:</strong> <i>The recent McStas 3.0 marks a big step
forward with added support for acceleration on NVIDIA GPUs. The
presentation will highlight the main changes between the McStas 2 and
McStas 3 series and with emphasis on what modifications are needed to
port an existing instrument or component. Finally the presentation
will discuss the areas of McStas 3 that are not yet fully developed
and mature.</i>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDwZ_ryPl5M">McStas Union
components (Mads Bertelsen)</a> <br><strong>Abstract:</strong> <i>The
McStas Union components is a set of components that are used in
together to describe complex parts of neutron instruments where
multiple scattering can be an important aspect. The user will describe
scattering properties in a modular fashion to describe
materials. Complex geometry can be described, allowing hollow regions,
windows and similar with full multiple scattering, which is especially
useful for simulating sample environments. The talk will have a focus
on the practical use of these components, teaching the basic concepts,
as well as showcasing what can be achieved.</i>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeM2S4ht9hM">McStasScript
(Mads Bertelsen)</a> <br><strong>Abstract:</strong> <i>As python has
become the main language for scientific software, it was decided to
introduce a python interface to McStas called McStasScript. Using
McStasScript a user can describe an instrument, perform simulations
and analyze the data directly from a python script. This simplifies
including McStas in more advanced workflows. The talk will introduce
McStasScript and show how it allows using McStas in a new way that
appeals to both new and experienced users.</i>

<h2>February 9th, 2021: Updated miniconda3 packages for v.2.7 and 3.0
on CentOS</h2>
<p>Dear all,
<p>We have recently discovered issues with binary-compatibility of
some miniconda3-based Python modules in both 2.7 and 3.0 on
CentOS. As a consequence, the related packages have been updated on 
the download page plus in our repo.
