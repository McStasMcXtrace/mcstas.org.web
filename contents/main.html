McStas - A neutron ray-trace simulation package</h1></center>
McStas is a general tool for simulating neutron scattering instruments
and experiments. It is actively supported by <a

href="http://www.nbi.dk">NBI KU</a>, <a
href="http://www.europeanspallationsource.se">ESS</a>, <a href="http://www.psi.ch">PSI</a> and <a href="http://www.ill.eu">ILL</a>.&nbsp;

highest intensity). The sample is at the center of the sphere with the
neutron beam coming from the left. Clearly seen is the shadowing effect
of the sample causing a lower intensity opposite the beam. Also seen is
the effect of the non-symmetric geometry of the sample, causing lower intensity
directly above and to the side of the sample.<br clear="BOTH"></td><td><img src="/pics/McStas-25-years.png" width="250"  hspace="15" align="RIGHT"></td></tr></tbody></table>

<h2>May 16th, 2024: (experimental) previews of the forthcoming 3.5-release</h2>
<p>Dear all,
<p>If you want a sneak preview at the forthcoming 3.5-release, we recommend you
to try either
<ul>
  <li>Our <a href="https://github.com/conda-forge/mcstas-suite-feedstock/">conda-forge packages</a>
  <br>(NB: The Windows version of the package does <strong>not</strong> include MCPL and NCrystal yet)
  <li>A new set of <a href="https://tmp.mcstas.org/macOS-conda-apps/">conda-based macOS app bundles</a>
  <br>(Based on conda-forge and should auto-download the newest conda-package plus dependencies)
  <li>Corresponding Debian packages, Windows/MinGW package and macOS/Intel package are built on a nightly basis via GitHub action "mcstas-autobuild") see e.g. <a href="https://github.com/McStasMcXtrace/McCode/actions/runs/9113127761">this latest one</a>  <br>(The packages are available in the "artifacts", download may require being logged in on GitHub. Somewhat confusingly, the Windows build is enclosed in the "ubuntu" artifact.)
</ul>
<p>Among the hightlights are:
<ol>
  <li>New default-<code>CFLAGS</code>
    <br>(Gives improved simulation performance of ~ 30-40% when using <code>gcc</code> and/or <code>clang</code> on Unix platforms at the cost of 5-10% longer compile time. -
    <br>Thanks to Thomas Kittelmann for help debugging a slowdown found when using the built-in compilers on conda :-) )
  <li>Tighter integration with <a href="https://github.com/PaNOSC-ViNYL/McStasScript">McStasScript</a>
  <br>(<code>mcstas-pygen</code>-driven button in <code>mcgui</code> directly spawns JupyterLab with a generated notebook)
  <li><a href="https://github.com/PaNOSC-ViNYL/McStasScript">McStasScript</a> is automatically included and configured on mac and Windows builds
  <li>We have started organising the <a href="https://github.com/McStasMcXtrace/McCode/tree/main/mcstas-comps/examples">instrument-<code>examples</code></a> in a folder-structure,
    allowing to distribute "more than just the instrument-file" as an example.
  <br>(Case-specific datafiles or geometry-files, c-code snippets, python scripts or McStasScript notebooks welcome - we still want new <code>comps</code> to arrive in <code>contrib</code>)
  <li>New <code>GISANS_sample.comp</code> contribution from Henrich Frielinghaus, allows to simulate selected samples for Grazing Incidence SANS.
  <li>New <code>File.comp</code> contribution from Greg Tucker, allows to use <code>metadata</code> blocks to store input-files for components
  <br>(e.g. for a small OFF file or other datafile - then visible alongside <code>instr</code> in your editor.)
  <li>... and we are working on freshening up certain aspects of the 3D-visualisation... ;-) <br>(New visualisation is not yet included in the above-mentioned packages...)
</ol>
<p><strong>Do you have new component- or instrument-developments you would like included in next release?</strong><br>- Then <strong>NOW</strong> is a good time to send them. :-) We prefer of you open a <a href="https://github.com/McStasMcXtrace/McCode/pulls">PR on GitHub</a> but of course email-based contributions are also welcome. :-)
<p>Finally, if you know anyone running <a href="https://www.mcxtrace.org">McXtrace</a> all
of the above should also work for them. And going forward, releases of
McStas and McXtrace should come in pairs with the same versioning.
