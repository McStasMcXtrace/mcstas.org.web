<h1>Test results for the powder sample component</h1>

This experiment tests the functioning of the <code>Powder1</code> powder
sample component. The instrument setup consists of the
<a href="../../Source_flat/">source</a> aimed at a
<a href="../../Powder1/">powder sample</a>. The Debye-Scherrer cone is
detected with a big
<a href="../../PSD_monitor/">2D PSD monitor</a>, and a cross-section
of the cone is measured with a linear PSD. Finally, a
<a href="../../PSD_monitor_4PI/">4PI PSD monitor</a> is thrown in
for good measure.

This plot shows the Debye-Scherrer cone projected onto the big PSD. The plot
was obtained from a small sample with height and diameter of 1cm.

This plot shows the Debye-Scherrer cone from a large sample (height and
diameter of 10cm) placed in a wide beam. The ring appears stretched out at the
outside. This is an artifact of the difference in incident angle of the
neutrons on the PSD active surface (the PSD surface is not perpendicular to
the neutrons).

This plot shows the source in the focusing mode, where only a part of the cone
is emitted to avoid spending computation time on useless neutrons.

This is a plot of the small linear PSD using the large (10cm) sample, and
shows a cross-section of the Debye-Scherrer cone (the small PSD is
perpendicular to the detected neutrons, so the stretching effect of the big
PSD does not appear here).

This is a plot of the 4PI PSD using the thick (10cm) sample, showing part of
the Debye-Scherrer cone projected onto the spherical detector surface.
