<h1>Test results for the collimator and slit components</h1>

This experiment tests the functioning of the <code>Collimator</code> and
<code>Slit</code> components. The instrument setup consists of the <a
href="../../Source_flat/">source</a> aimed at a <a href="../../Slit/">slit</a>
overlapped with a <a href="../../PSD_monitor/">flat PSD monitor</a>. After the
slit comes a <a href="../../Collimator/">collimator</a> that may be rotated,
then another slit and finally a <a href="../../Monitor/">single
detector</a>. A <a href="../../PSD_monitor_4PI/">4PI PSD monitor</a> with
large radius borders the setup. The source is at a large distance to the other
components so that the neutron beam has a very small divergence.

This graph shows a plot of the single detector as the collimator is rotated
around the Y axis. It is clearly seen how the collimator permits only neutrons
within the divergence of the collimator (here 1 degree) to pass through, and
the triangular-shaped transmission probability function is also seen.

This graph shows a plot of the single detector as the collimator is rotated
around the X axis. At 90 degrees, the collimator opening is parrallel to the
beam and no neutrons can pass through. From 90 to 60 degrees a gradually
larger part of the beam hits the collimator opening, and at less than 60
degrees the beam is fully within the collimator and all neutrons may pass.

This is a plot from the flat PSD that shows the absorbtion from the first
slit.

This is a plot from the 4PI PSD. Only a narrow beam emerges from the
instrument.
