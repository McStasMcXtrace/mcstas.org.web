<h1>McStas results</h1>

The necessary component and instrument definitions have been developed for the
TAS1 spectrometer at Risø, a "standard" triple-axis spectrometer. Using these,
McStas simulations have been conducted and compared with experimental
measurements. A <a href="tas1/linup/">report on the results</a> is
available.

<P>
Some other interesting results:

Various other test simulations have been run to verify that components are working properly. Note that these tests were run with an old, pre-release version of the component library, and so probably will not run without modification on
McStas v1.0 or later.
