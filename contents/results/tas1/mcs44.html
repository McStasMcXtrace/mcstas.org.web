<h1>McStas TAS1 simulation first results - mcs00044</h1>

<P>
This experiment is a Q-scan in 2-axis focusing mode on the Al2O3
sample. 5meV neutrons with the filter down. Collimation is 60' in the S-A
position and open A-D.

Mfit does not do much useful with the simulated data (fitting does not
converge or behaves strangely). Hand-fitting suggests the following, which is
very close to the measured data:
<PRE>
  Parameter       Value      Uncertainty
  Amplitude     5.2000e-07    0.0000e+00

<P>
The center of the peaks do not agree completely. This may be due to a
misaligned sample during the measurements (it was about 1mm off center). We
may investigate this by simulating a similarly offset sample in the instrument
definition.

<P>
This is a comparison (no fitting) between simulated (blue) and measured
data, corrected for 0.05 degrees off-center peak. Clearly the width is very
close, but just as clearly the shapes do not match perfectly. Apparently the
simulation just does not result in a gauss shaped peak.
