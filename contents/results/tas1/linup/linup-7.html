<h1>2TA scan on vanadium, 30'/28'/open collimation</h1>

<h2>Measurements</h2>

Now a vanadium sample is placed in the sample position and S-A collimator C1
(28') is mounted. No analysator. 2TA is scanned from -3° to 3° with
10sec/point. Data file

<h2>Simulations</h2>

<P>
This is the result <a href="linup_7.sim"><TT>linup_7.sim</TT></a> of
simulation with 5e6 neutrons.

This graph reveals a problem in the simulation. The curve is strongly
non-symetric around 2TA=0 and the intensity completely vanishes for 2TA <
-1.5. To investigate this, the simulation was repeated with a linear PSD
placed just in front of the vanadium sample in order to measure the beam
cross-section at the sample position. The following graph shows the beam
intensity as a function of the distance from the center of the sample:

<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="sample_check_7.gif"></P>

We notice two things on this graph. First, the beam is rather narrow at the
sample position, about the same as the sample diameter (20mm). Second, the
beam is not centered on the sample, being offset about 1.5mm. This means that
part of the sample is not being illuminated by the beam, causing the asymetry
in the measured intensity in the detector.

<P>
The measurements do not suggest that this "beam misses sample" scenario
occured during the experiments. Two possible explanations suggests
themselves. One is that the effective collimation of C1 was larger than 30',
as is also suggested by the previous <a href="linup-4.html">PHM scan with 30'
C1 collimation</a>. This could be caused by non-neglible transmission through
collimator blades (which is not taken into account in the simulation), or the
30' value could simply be wrong.

<P>
The other possibility, which we investigate here, is that the beam was
actually better centered on the sample in the experiment. The previous
simulation was thus repeated, this time with 2e6 neutrons and the sample
offset 1.5mm perpendicular to the beam. This is the result <a
href="linup_7_15.sim"><TT>linup_7_15.sim</TT></a>:

<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="fit_7_15.gif"></P>
<PRE>
  Amplitude     1.6992e-06    3.4562e-08
  Centre        5.9956e-02    1.9113e-02
  Width         1.3078e+00    3.8744e-02
  Background   -4.5606e-08    2.4305e-08

* Chi Squared 2.5814
</PRE>

As can be seen, the previous asymetry has disappeared, and can thus be
completely attributed to the misalignment of the sample in the beam.


<h2>Comparison</h2>

<P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="cmp_7_15.gif"></P>

The simulated data is somewhat narrower than the measured. This could be
due to a too-narow beam at the sample position during simulations caused by an
effective C1 collimation larger than 30' during the experiment. This needs
further investigation.
