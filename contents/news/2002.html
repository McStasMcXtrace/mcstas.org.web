October 17th: Cure for mcplot problems?</h3>
Today, a possible cure for problems with mcplot on recent versions of
the support software (perl/PDL/pgplot...) was probably found. The
changes made are explained in <a
href="pipermail/neutron-mc/2002q4/000512.html">this</a> email to <a
href="mailto:neutron-mc@risoe.dk">neutron-mc@risoe.dk</a>. Modified
versions of mcplotlib.pl are available for <a
href="download/src/mcplotlib.pl-1.5">mcstas-1.5</a> and <a
href="download/src/mcplotlib.pl-1.6.1-ill">mcstas-1.6.1-ill</a>.

September 2nd, 2002: McStas Survey 2002</h3>
<p>To make sure that the McStas project is re-launched with success, we
have decided to do a little survey among the McStas users, to ensure
that the opinions within the community are reflected in the oncoming
versions of the software.
<p>For example, many users have indicated that the current setup of the
McStas tools (e.g. mcrun, mcplot, etc.) is becoming very complicated
to install on some platforms. This will be dealt with in the next
release, on basis of the result of this survey.
 
<p>Also, we would very much like to know what versions of McStas that the
user base is using and on which platforms the software runs.
 
<p>The survey should only take a few minutes to complete, and is
available at 
<p><a href="http://fys-lin-1.risoe.dk/mcstas-survey">http://fys-lin-1.risoe.dk/mcstas-survey</a>. 
<p>You can sign your qustionaire or leave it anonymous,
 as preferred.
 
<p>We hope that you will find the few minutes needed to complete the survey,
and thus help us in making McStas a better software.

<p>Note: The submission deadline of the survey will be 

<p><b>Friday September 21st 2002.</b>

Due to hardware problem, the McStas server has been down for a while. The
web-pages are moved to a central Ris&oslash; web-server. Some facilities
using perl-scripts may not work initially. We will also find a solution

<h3>
January 17, 2002: McStas 1.5 information</h3>
<b>Sources: </b>In McStas 1.4, illumination was not treated correctly in
the standard source components. Updated versions were included in 1.5,
but they contained unfortunately a stupid error. Corrected versions (compared
to the 1.5 release) of <b>Source_flat</b>, <b>Source_flat_lambda</b>, and
<b>Source_flux_lambda</b>
are available on the web. There are still problems with <b>Source_Maxwell
</b>and<b>
Source_adapt</b>.
<p>The first McStas-1.5.tar.gz that was put on the web was unfortunately
useless. Accidentally, this overlapped with router&nbsp; problems at Ris&oslash;
and the Ris&oslash; web was unaccessible for the users. Thanks to Garrett
Granroth, who apparantly was the first user who downloaded it, it could
be replaced October 15 without any noticeable inconvenience for the user
community.
<p>Internal changes in version 1.5 of the McStas kernel have caused problems
in some components. In particular,&nbsp; <i>mccompcurname </i>has been
used in some components. It was for example the problem with the unofficial
component <b>Flux_adapter</b> in the problem reported by <a href="/neutron-mc/arch/0110/msg00007.html">Ulrich
Wildgruber</a>. In addition, the official components <b>Source_gen</b>,
<b>Gravity_guide</b>,
<b>Monitor_nD</b>,
<b>PreMonitor_nD</b>, and <b>Source_Optimizer
</b>also
contain <i>mccompcurname</i>.&nbsp;
