April 14th: Estimated release date of mcstas-1.7.</h3>
 At the
Prague <a
href="http://www.studsvik.uu.se/software/scans/scans.htm">SCANS</a>
meeting, the developers agreed to release the new version
approximately <b>mid may 2003</b>! You may have a look at the slides from our
SCANS presentation (links below) to get a glimpse of new features in
 the tools... <p>The only stuff we need to do before release is 
<ul>
<li>"Burn in test" - the development release fully functional but
still has <i>beta</i> status
<li>Doc update. The manual needs an overhaul.
</ul>
The <a href="/developments/status">staus page</a> has been updated accordingly.
