New download area for contributions and minor fixes
</h3>
<p>The website has been enriched with a <a
href="/download/share">shared files</a> area, meant for useful files
not part of the current distribution.
<p>We foresee to use the area for allowing updates of individual files
between releases, as well as making user scripts and tools not part of
the distribution available.

<h3>
Ph.D. students and/or post docs for instrument simulation for the ESS
</h3>
<p>In connection with the design update of the planned neutron facility: the European Spallation Source (ESS) in Lund, we seek two talented young scientists to perform simulations and optimisations of possible instruments to be built at ESS.
<h4>Employer and location:</h4>
The two persons will be employed at the Technical University of Denmark and at the University of Copenhagen, respectively. However, both will be associated with the ESS project.
<h4>The group:</h4>
Both persons will work together in the ESS simulation group, counting around 10 persons. This group will be a part of / collaborate with the 60-person ESS Data Management Center, which is presently under construction in Copenhagen.
<h4>Job description:</h4>
You will design neutron scattering instruments for ESS using the tools developed in the McStas simulation package. This work will be carried out in collaboration with instrument experts located both in Lund and around the world. For the judgement of the instrument performance, you will perform virtual experiments on samples typical for the particular instrument. In this connection, you will take part in the development of the tools and algorithms to correctly describe neutron scattering samples.
<h4>Qualifications:</h4>
You must have a suitable university degree (M.Sc. or Ph.D., respectively) within Physics, Chemistry, Engineering, or equivalent. You should have good computing skills, have a good sense of data quality, and be able to work within a team. Furthermore, you should have a good understanding of modeling of physical properties. Specific experience within X-ray and neutron scattering is considered an advantage, but is not required.
<h4>Terms of employment:</h4>
The salary and appointment terms are consistent with the current rules
for PhD degree students or post docs. The Ph.D. position(s) is a fixed-term 3 year employment. The post doc position(s) will be a 2-year contract with a possibility for extension, given sufficient funds.

Both University of Copenhagen and DTU wish to reflect the diversity of society and welcomes applications from all qualified candidates regardless of personal background.

Applications should be submitted by email to lefmann@fys.ku.dk or pkwi@risoe.dtu.dk by August 27th 2010 and should include:
<ul>
<li>A statement of research interests and motivation
<li>Transcript of examinations undertaken at your home university (for Ph.D. candidates).
<li>Master degree / Ph.D. degree certificate (if not available, then include proof of expected date for obtaining such degree in the CV).
<li>CV (max. 3 pages)
<li>Please mention 2 contact references in the CV.
</ul>

July 15th, 2010: McStas 1.12b released!
</h3>
<p>The McStas developer team is happy to report that the 1.12b release of
our software is finally out.

<p>You can get the installer packages from our <a
href="/download">download page</a>

<p>McStas 1.12b is mostly a bugfix release, but some new components and example
instruments have been included. McStas 1.12b will be the <strong>VERY</strong> last release in 
the 1.x series.

<p>Part of the reason for McStas 1.12b and its late arrival is our delay in releasing the next
major version, McStas 2.0.

<p>McStas 2.0 will be released late 2010 / early 2011 and will introduce new features that
could break ceartain backward compatibility, hence we move from the 1.x series. We are 
also considering a replacement of the GUI and plotting tools for McStas 2.0.

<p>For a complete list of changes in McStas 1.12b, see our <a
href="/download/src/CHANGES">CHANGES</a> document.

<p>The new relase was tested on these platforms:
<ul>
  <li>Mac OS 10.5 Leopard and 10.6 Snow Leopard (but should work on
  10.4 and 10.3 also). Both 32 and 64 bit, Intel and PPC systems are supported.
  <li>Ubuntu Linux 9.10 Karmic Koala and 10.04 Lucid Lynx, 32 and 64
  bit .deb's are provided. <strong>Note: Do not expect these debs to
  work on earlier releases or other distributions, e.g. Debian</strong>
  <li>Windows XP, Vista and 7, 32 and 64 bit. We only provide 32bit
  executables, but they are tested to run OK on 64 bit
  <li>On other systems, feel free to try our source distributions
</ul>

May 26th, 2010: McStas / VITESS user training workshop 2010 has ended
</h3>
<p>Last week, several McStas and VITESS team members teamed up
organising a joint <a
href="http://ven2010.essworkshop.org">McStas/VITESS user training</a>.
<p>The event was generously sponsored by
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.ess-scandinavia.eu">ESS Scandinavia</a>
  <li><a href="http://neutron.neutron-eu.net/n_nmi3fp7">NMI3 / FP7</a>
  <li><a href="http://www.risoe.dtu.dk/en/About_risoe/research_departments/AFM.aspx">Ris&oslash; DTU</a>
</ul>
<p>The used teaching material has been made publicly available at <a
href="http://ven2010.essworkshop.org/storage">http://ven2010.essworkshop.org/storage</a>
<p>A pre-release of McStas 1.12b was used by the participants, and
this burn-in-test indicates that we can release a new stable McStas
within a few weeks.
<p>The organising committee would like to thank all participants, also
for their very positive feedback about the event.

March 8th, 2010: McStas / VITESS user training workshop 2010
</h3>
<p>The McStas and VITESS teams are happy to announce the joint

<p><b>McStas / VITESS user training workshop 2010</b>

<p>To take place at Backafallsbyn in the Swedish island of Ven, May 17th-21st.

<p>The workshop is a school in order to train technical staff and instrument scientists in using Monte-Carlo code to design better neutron devices and instruments. The programme is split into sessions dedicated to different parts (optics, sample environment, detectors, ...). If you work in one of these areas, and feel like simulating it, then this school is for you, especially if you've never done so before. 

<p><b>Sponsorship / Participation / Cost</b><br>Generous support from our sponsors
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.ess-scandinavia.eu">ESS Scandinavia</a>
  <li><a href="http://neutron.neutron-eu.net/n_nmi3fp7">NMI3 / FP7</a>
  <li><a href="http://www.risoe.dtu.dk/en/About_risoe/research_departments/AFM.aspx">Ris&oslash; DTU</a>
</ul>
has made it possible to offer sponsored lodging and participation for up to 25 people. If more than 25 people show an interest, a fee will be announced for further participation, that is the first 25 registrations will be free, the up-to-5 following will require accommodation charge (about 600 euros for the entire school).

<p>We would like all participants to attend, as far as possible, the <b>entire</b> school. 
 
<p>All participants must arrange and pay their own transport to Copenhagen Airport. We will arrange joint transportation from CPH to the Island of Ven.
