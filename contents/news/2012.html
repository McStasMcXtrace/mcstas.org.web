December 2nd, 2012: McStas 2.0RC2 public beta released
</h3>
<p>A bug in the internal path definitions of the RC1 packages
prevented the tools from working properly on Unix systems. For this
reason, I have pushed the update 2.0RC2 to <a href="http://mcstas-20rc2.mcstas.org">http://mcstas-20rc2.mcstas.org</a>

<p>Sorry for any inconvenience

November 30th, 2012: McStas 2.0RC1 public beta released
</h3>
<p>A public beta release of McStas 2.0 called 2.0RC1 has finally been released!

<p>McStas 2.0RC1 is a public beta leading up to the long awaited official McStas 2.0. It is a beta release, but we expect that differences to 2.0 will be minimal.

<p>The full and long list of changes since last official release is
available here: <a href="http://mcstas-20rc1.mcstas.org/CHANGES_McStas">http://mcstas-20rc1.mcstas.org/CHANGES_McStas</a>

<p>* If you do not find yourself credited in the long list of contributions - please remind me *

<p>* There is still time if you have contributions you would like us to include in the official 2.0 *

<p>McStas 2.0RC1 is available through this link: <a href="http://mcstas-20rc1.mcstas.org">http://mcstas-20rc1.mcstas.org</a> for the following platforms

<ul>
  <li> Linux deb based distros 32 and 64 bit - tested on Debian testing and Ubuntu 64bit

  <li> Windows 32 and 64 bit - tested on Windows XP, Windows 7 and Windows 8
</ul>

<p>!! Please read the README file provided with each platform type before installing !!

<p>For Unix systems we provide a migration script that will allow you to let an existing 1.x release (i.e. 1.12c) co-exist with the new release.

<p>Enjoy! :-)

July 27th, 2012: McStas 1.12c on Mac OS X Mountain Lion - new DMG added to
download section.
</h3>
<p>A new DMG for Mac OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion has been put together and can be
found in the <a href="/download">download</a> section.
<p>As Apple have discontinued distribution of X11, you need to install
<a href="http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/">XQuartz</a> before
installing McStas.
<p>You also need to install Command Line Tools inside Xcode
(Xcode -> Preferences-> Downloads -> Components) and also allow
installation of third party software (System Preferences -> Security &
Privacy -> General -> Allow applications downloaded from:
Anywhere) - can be reset after installation of SciPDL etc. from the DMG.
<p>Note that to enable multi-core / parallel simulations, you need to
compile <a
href="http://www.open-mpi.org/software/ompi/">openmpi</a>
yourself before installing McStas, since it is not provided by Apple
on Lion and Mountain Lion. Alternatively you can perhaps get it via <a
href="http://www.macports.org">MacPorts</a>.
<p>The DMG should also work on Lion - but all software on the DMG
  must be reinstalled if McStas was previously installed.

July 5th: PSI RITA-II instrument available for <a href="/download/share/L_Udby_RITA-II.tgz">download</a>
</h3>
<p>Linda Udby has contributed her detailed description of the RITA-II
instrument for use with McStas 1.12c. <a target=_blank href="http://spectroscopy.web.psi.ch/rita2/">RITA-II</a> is
a so-called re-invented triple axis with a multiplexed analyzer
system. The contribution can be downloaded  <a href="/download/share/">from our share section</a> (instrument <a href="/download/share/L_Udby_RITA-II.tgz.html">info</a>).
<p>As part of her PhD thesis, Linda used this very detailed model of
RITA-II to perform virtual
experiments, thereby deriving analysis parameters for her studies of
Superoxygenated LSCO.
<p>The hkl routine embedded in the instrument code is similar to what
is found in templateTAS by Emmanuel Farhi. Further, the instrument
features a multitude of input parameters to control all aspects of the
virtual experiment. The instrument contains both an incoherent
scatterer, a powder sample, a single crystal and a phonon-simple that
can be selected using input parameters.
<p>The McStas team are really greatful for this nice
contribution that will also be 
be part of McStas 2.0.

Vacancy at the ESS DMSC as scientific software developer
</h3>
<p>The interim ESS DMSC (Data Management and Software Center for the European Spallation Source) located at the Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen is seeking a candidate for scientific software development within areas of data analysis and simulation. More specifically, the work is oriented toward integration of the McStas and Mantid software packages.

<p>The advert is available through this <a href="https://ssl1.peoplexs.com/Peoplexs22/CandidatesPortalNoLogin/Vacancy.cfm?PortalID=3417&VacatureID=241334&BedrijfID=0&Vacancy=Scientific%20software%20development%20#top">link</a>.

March 12th: Respin of McStas 1.12c dmg for OS X Lion
</h3>
<p>As reported to <a
href="http://mailman.mcstas.org/pipermail/mcstas-users/2012q1/001768.html">mcstas-users@mcstas.org</a>,
the McStas 1.12c dmg for OS X Lion was unfortunately corrupt. A new version of the
image has been <a
href="/download/McStas-1.12c-OSX-Lion-respin.dmg">uploaded</a>. The
filename is slightly different to be able to distinguish the image
from older downloads you may have.

<h3>
February 1st: Various bugs and workarounds
</h3>
<p>A couple of annoyances have been reported, here they are plus
relevant workarounds:
<ul>
<li>1.12c version of SNS_source.comp crashes on Windows
systems. A functional version has been uploaded <a
href="/download/share/SNS_source.comp">to the share</a>. Thanks to
Ruep Lechner for reporting the bug and to Garrett Granroth for
providing a fixed component.
<li>The previously released updated dmg image for Mac OS X should really
  only be used on Lion, not Snow Leopard, that is use <a
  href="/download/McStas-1.12c-OSX-Lion-respin.dmg">this image on Lion</a>
  and <a href="/download/McStas-1.12c-OSX.dmg">this image on older
  releases</a>.
<li>On (at least some) Mac systems, it seems Virtual_output.comp should not be used
  with type="double" or "float". The workaround for the time being is
  to use the default "text" format instead. The issue seems to become
  more severe if large ncounts are used.
</ul>

January 6th: New affiliation for Erik Knudsen and Peter Willendrup
</h3>
<p>
A reorganisation at <a href="http://www.dtu.dk">DTU</a> and <a
href="http://www.risoe.dtu.dk">RIS&Oslash; DTU</a> has resulted
in a new home for the <a href="http://www.dtu.dk">DTU</a> effort on
McStas, namely <a href="http://www.fysik.dtu.dk">DTU Physics</a>.
<p>
Hence, Erik Knudsen and Peter Willendrup have a new affiliation, see
the <a href="/about/contacts">Contact</a> page.
<p>At our new home we will be part of a dedicated neutron- and X-ray
scattering group, which we think will become a very good home!
