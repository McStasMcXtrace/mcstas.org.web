April 18th, 2006: Small corrections to <a href="/download">mcstas-1.9.1</a></h3>
A couple of minor bugs have been found in the mcstas-1.9.1 distribution package:<ul>
<li>The <a href="download/components/examples/PSI_Focus.html">Focus</a> example instrument distributed did not compile. To run this instrument with mcstas-1.9.1, <a href="download/components/examples/PSI_Focus.instr">download</a> and place in the MCSTAS/examples folder. (On Unix systems the MCSTAS directory is usually /usr/local/lib/mcstas, on windows machines, this typically c:\mcstas\lib)
<li>For people running McStas on FreeBSD and derived systems (tested on a
 FreeBSD 6.0 system), <a href="http://cvs.mcstas.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/mcstas/lib/share/mcstas-r.h?rev=1.80&content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup">mcstas-r.h</a> needs a minor correction. Please <a href="http://cvs.mcstas.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/mcstas/lib/share/mcstas-r.h?rev=1.80">download</a> and place in your MCSTAS/share/ directory.
</ul>.
