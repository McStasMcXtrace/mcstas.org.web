</h3>
<p>People running Ubuntu versions prior to 9.10 and McStas installed from the mcstas-1.12a.deb debian package are adviced NOT TO UPGRADE Ubuntu, as PGPLOT/Fortran related package dependencies can not easily be resolved.
<p>If you upgrade anyway or install from scratch on Ubuntu 9.10, the easiest way of getting McStas 1.12a working is:
<ol>
<li>Install certain Ubuntu packages by
<ul>
  <li>apt-get install gcc gfortran pdl pgplot5 libpgplot-perl perl-tk make
  <li>(optionally also mpich2 libmpich2-dev)
</ul>
<li>Run sudo dpkg-reconfigure dash,  say "no" to installing dash as /bin/sh
<li>Get the mcstas-1.12a-src.tar.gz package via <a href="/downloads/mcstas-1.12a-src.tar.gz">this link</a>
<li>Unpack, build and install by
<ul>
  <li>tar xzf mcstas-1.12a-src.tar.gz
  <li>cd mcstas-1.12a
  <li>./configure
  <li>make
  <li>sudo make install
</ul>
</ol>
<p>Alternatively, wait 1-2 months and McStas 2.0 should be ready.

</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, a couple of work-arounds are needed to install McStas on the new version of Mac OS. When following the instructions in README.TXT on the dmg image:
<ul>
  <li>Use <a href="http://tmp.mcstas.org/Tk-804.028_501.tar.gz">http://tmp.mcstas.org/Tk-804.028_501.tar.gz</a> instead of the Tk package on the dmg
  <li>After unpacking mcstas-1.12a-src.tar.gz, replace MacInstall.command in the resulting folder by <a target=_blank href="http://tmp.mcstas.org/MacInstall.command">this one</a>
</ul>

August 21st, 2009: Code repository changes.
</h3>
<p>As we want to share code with our "sister project" in X-ray scattering, <a href="http://www.mcxtrace.org">McXtrace</a>, a new common infrastructure is beeing built up. In the future, the McStas and McXtrace code repository, bug tracking etc. will be hosted under the <a href="http://www.mccode.org">McCode</a> domain. Consequently, some links and website features can be expected broken - and fixed - in the near future.

April 8th, 2009: Minor bug in McStas 1.12a (not to be updated)
</h3>
<p>It seems that one of the example instruments (prisma2.instr) can not be compiled with McStas 1.12 and the newest version of gcc, 4.3.2. Using the older, stable gcc 3.4 works just fine.

<p>The changes since last stable release (1.12) are available <a href="/download/src/CHANGES">here</a>.
