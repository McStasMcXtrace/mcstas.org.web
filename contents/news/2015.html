December 18th, 2015: Seasons greetings + a new ESS moderator comp released
</h3>
<p>We had hoped to have McStas 2.3 ready for release this year, but
time turned out too short and we simply did not make it. Hopes are that the next release will be
ready during January 2016 - very few things are missing.
<p>In the meantime we do have a small christmas present for the
ESS-oriented McStas users ready:<br>The ESS butterfly moderator is
finally available in the <a href="/download/share/ESS_moderator_December_2015.tgz">download share</a> - including support for both
the 3cm and 6cm height butterfly. The release also includes a small <a
href="/download/share/Reproducing_ESS_butterfly_brillances_with_McStas.pdf">guidance
document in PDF format</a>.
<p>All the best, Merry X-mas and a Happy New Year from
<br>the McStas team

September 15th, 2015: Missing manual PDF's uploaded.
</h3>
A user has pointed out that no links to manual PDF's were shown on the
<a href="/documentation/manual">manual</a> page, this problem has been
fixed as of today. The manuals indicate that they correspond to
version 2.1, september 2014... That version and date are typos - but also an indication that no
fundamental changes were made to the manual between 2.1 and 2.2a.

<h3>
June 10th, 2015: McStas-2.2a supplemental ZIP archives for Mac OS X.
</h3>
<p>At least one user has experienced problems installing on OS X Yosemite from the tgz
archive available <a
href="http://download.mcstas.org/mcstas-2.2a/mac">here</a>.
<p>The problem was investigated and was caused by corruption during
automatic 'double click' unarchiving of the tgz file. The solution was to unarchive using a 
tar command in the terminal:
<pre>tar xzf McStas-2.2a-10.10_Yosemite.tgz</pre>
<p>If you experience this type of problem, either untar manually as
shown above or try the ZIP version
of the relevant archive - available <a
href="http://download.mcstas.org/mcstas-2.2a/mac/ZIPfiles/">here</a>
. Content wise these archives are exactly the same as the tgz version.

<h3>
June 1st, 2015: Updated Ubuntu live-dvd with McStas available.
</h3>
<p>An <a href="http://ubuntu.mcstas.org/Ubuntu_14_04_McStas_2_2a_iFit_Mantid_x64.iso">updated iso image</a> based on Ubuntu 14.04 and including McStas
2.2a, 2.1, 2.0 and 1.12c has been uploaded to <a
href="http://ubuntu.mcstas.org">our Ubuntu dvd archive</a>. The iso
also included the latest release of <a
href="http://ifit.mccode.org">iFit</a> and <a href="http://www.mantidproject.org">Mantid</a>.

May 29th, 2015: Fresh built McStas 2.2a released
</h3>
<p>Dear all,

<p>The bug reported earlier today related to the initialization of our
random number generator was in fact not as severe as first
anticipated:

<p>Using a seed of 0 - which is the default in McStas and means using
the clock as random number seed, instead implicitly indeed set the
seed to 0 always. This meant
that to generate two simulations with statistically different output, one would have
had to set the seed explicitly to two different values in the two cases.

<p>In any case, the bug has now been fixed in the newly
released McStas 2.2a, which is available for all platforms at <a
href="http://downloads.mcstas.org/mcstas-2.2a">http://downloads.mcstas.org/mcstas-2.2a</a>.

<p>It further seems we have an issue with our "umbrella"-metapackage
(called <b>mcstas-suite</b>) for both Debian and RPM systems. The
solution is to explicitly install the <b>mcstas-suite-perl</b>
and/or <b>mcstas-suite-python</b> packages.

<p>Best regards,

<p>Peter Willendrup<hr>

May 29th, 2015: Random number generator bug in McStas 2.2.
</h3>
<p>Dear all,


<p>We have unfortunately discovered a serious bug in random number generation in the newly released McStas 2.2.

<p>A patched replacement-release will be released either today or early next week. Sorry for the inconvenience this may have caused you.


<p>Best regards,

<p>Peter Willendrup

    <ul>
      <li>McStas (and its X-ray counterpart McXtrace) are now on GitHub, see

    </ul>
    <li><b>Components:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>A new model for the ESS butterfly moderator - see documentation for the ESS_moderator.comp. Developed by
      Peter Willendrup in close collaboration with Troels Schoenfeldt
      DTU Nutech/ESS.<br><b>** A separate document with recommended
      settings for this component will be released later, also a
      version backported to McStas 1.12c. **</b>
      <li>The Isotropic_Sqw component was broken in McStas 2.1. The

      QT and Scintilla. We think it is a very nice start at this
      long-awaited replacement of mcgui (Perl) and want
      you to try it out even though a few edges may still be rough
      here and there. For installation instructions, see the README's included with the installation packages.
      <li>McStas 2.2 further includes a simple mcplot plotter for Unix platforms (Linux, OS X) based solely on 
   shell-script + Matlab/iFit/Octave, no need for Perl or Python with this plotter, called mcplot-matlab

February 19th, 2015: Bugfixed-release of the ESS_moderator.comp
</h3>
<p>Jan Saroun from NPI in Czech Republic (and author of
RESTRAX/SIMRES) has spotted an unfortunate error in the
ESS_moderator.comp component, relating to the 2014 "pancake" case.
<p>The bug is a missing distance-factor in a solid-angle computation
and will lead to a too high brilliance emitted from the source.
<p>Unfortunately was never spotted in our tests since these happen with an
instrument where this distance is set to 1 m... (and 1 x 1 = 1... )
<p>The updated source packge for use with McStas 1.12c and 2.x is
available for download at <a
href="http://mcstas.org/download/share/ESS_moderator_February_2015.tgz">http://mcstas.org/download/share/ESS_moderator_February_2015.tgz</a>. A
set of "release notes" is available at <a href="http://mcstas.org/download/share/ESS_moderator_February_2015.tgz.html">http://mcstas.org/download/share/ESS_moderator_February_2015.tgz.html</a>.
<p>Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause.

<h3>
February 10th, 2015: Supplemental documentation for ESS moderators in McStas
</h3>
<p>A number of McStas users have expressed that the documentation for the
ESS_moderator component distributed with McStas is not completely
clear. To remedy this, Ken Andersen and I have (with the help of data
from Troels Schönfeldt) produced a supplemental <a href="downloads/share/Reproducing_ESS_TDR_and_pancake_brillances_with_McStas.pdf">PDF document</a> that will hopefully help.

<p>Please note that at this point, only TDR-like and pancake moderators
are described in McStas. An updated set of moderator descriptions will
be released with McStas 2.2 during the spring of 2015.
