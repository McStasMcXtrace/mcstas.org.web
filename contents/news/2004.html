<h3>
March 5th, 2004: McStas 1.8 is here!</h3>
<p>The new version is finally out! Get it from the <a
href="/download">download</a> page!
<p>A lot of new and improved stuff is in there, have a look at the <a
href="/download/src/CHANGES">CHANGES</a> document.
<p>Two other important pieces of information is that 
<ul>
<li>McStas is now formally covered by the <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/#GPL">GNU General Public License</a>
<li>We now offer nightly <a href="/cvs">CVS
builds</a> of what we have in the development source tree. Please note
that the CVS versions are not to be regarded as stable:
<ul><li>Features may come and go
<li>Bugs <strong>will</strong> occur
<li>But you will always have the 'bleeding edge' features of McStas
</ul>
</ul>
<p>The reason for providing CVS versions and licensing by the GPL is
to further encourage contributions to the project. Our policy is that
anyone who wants to contribute something useful should be allowed to,
and will be given proper credit for his work. The current release
includes work by the core <a href="/about/contacts/">developer
team</a> as well as:
<ul><li>Stuart Ansell and Dickon Champion, ISIS
<li>Uwe Filges, PSI
<li>Chris Ling, Ross Stewart, ILL
<li>Lise Arleth, Ris&oslash;
</ul>
Thank you for your contributions!

February 18th, 2004: Mailing list + new search capabilities</h3>
<p>On February 10th, the McStas mailinglist was restored.
<p>Today, a new <a href="/search">search</a> page was added to the
website. This enables McStas users to search the McStas websites at
<a href="http://www.risoe.dk/">RIS&Oslash;</a> and <a
href="http://www.ill.fr/tas/mcstas/mcstas_ill.html">ILL</a> as well

January 29th, 2004: Mailing list / website trouble</h3>
<p>The Ris&oslash; IT department has been updating the webserver
running the mailinglist and website of McStas. Because of
technical problems the website has been down for a couple of days,
and the mailinglist is still not functioning correctly. We hope to
have everything working again soon.
