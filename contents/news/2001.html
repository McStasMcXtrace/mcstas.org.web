<h3>
October 9, 2001: New components added</h3>
The following monitors have been added: <b>EPSD_monitor</b>, <b>PSDcyl_monitor</b>,
<b>PSDlin_monitor</b>,
<b>TOF_cylPSD_monitor</b>,
<b>TOFlog_mon</b>,
and

October 9, 2001: Problems with access to McStas web-page</h3>
The McStas web-page has been unavailable for approximately a week. It was
caused by some hardware problems at Ris&oslash;, and, in particular, the
new fire-wall at Ris&oslash;. We hope that these problems have been solved
properly.

<h3>
September 18, 2001: Error in Channeled_guide and Gravity_guide</h3>
Andrew Wildes and Emmanuel Farhi have detected an error when using focusing
geometry in <b>Channeled_guide</b>. The slope of the channels is not computed
corrected correctly, because the same left and right slopes are used in
all channels. This has now been included properly in <b>Gravity_guide</b>,
and it is recommended that this component is used.
<br>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<h3>
September 18, 2001: An error has been found in the source components</h3>
The illumination is not calculated correctly. This will corrected in McStas
1.5 and the release will therefore be delayed a couple of days. The intention
is that McStas will be released within a couple of days.

for a three-component representation of the spin is available and the polarisation
state vector has been added to all components in the McStas release. It
should be emphasized, however, that in the current version no components
actually modify the spin vector. Further information is found at the <a href="developments/developments.html">Developments

February 8, 2001: Link to <a href="http://129.187.179.18/">StatMon homepage</a></h3>
A link is provided to the StatMon homepage. StatMon is a graphical user
interface for monitoring McStas simulations developed by Stephan Gekle
and Ulrich C. Wildgruber. It was tested at the McStas workshop at Ris&oslash;
in January, and it was concluded that this kind of Java-based GUI:s are
and will be very useful. Consequently, it was decided that the McStas kernel
will be modified to support StatMon. McStas users are also encouraged to
use and test StatMon and to suggest further developments along these lines.
