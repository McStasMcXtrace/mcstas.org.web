Nov 28th: Monitor_nD: avoid using <i>"per cm2"</i> and <i>"per steradian"</i> options
</h3>
<p>
A minor bug that affects Monitor_nD has been found recently. It results in spikes appearing randomly in the monitored distributions. To temporarily avoid it, do not use the <i>options="... per cm2 ..."</i> and <i>"... per steradian ..."</i> component arguments. To obtain the flux per cm2 or steradian, divide manually the result by the monitor area or the effective solid angle.

Nov 9th, 2011: Installation with MPI on Linux/Ubuntu 11.10
</h3>
<p>
It has been reported that the mpich2 parallel processing library should be avoided under Ubuntu 11.10 ('mpd' clashes with an other executable). Please install instead <a href="www.open-mpi.org/">openmpi</a> with e.g.:<br>
<pre>
  # sudo apt-get install openmpi-bin libopenmpi-dev
</pre>
or from Synaptic/Ubuntu Software Center. <br>
In case Mcstas was installed before openmpi, you will need to re-configure it with e.g.: <br>
<pre>
  # cd /usr/local/lib/mcstas/tools/perl
  # sudo chmod a+x mcstas_reconfigure
  # sudo ./mcstas_reconfigure
</pre>
or change your <code>$HOME/.mcstas/mccode_config.perl</code>, or re-install it (which should not affect your instrument definitions).

Oct 31st, 2011: LEGO (c) neutron scattering instruments controlled with McStas
</h3>
<p>We have set-up <a href="http://www.lego.com/">LEGO</a> models of a <b>TAS</b> and <b>crystal TOF</b> instrument, 
using the <a href="http://mindstorms.lego.com/">NXT</a> technology. 
This is a robotic model (it moves) to be used for teaching/training and in exhibitions. 
When a McStas simulation is launched on the PC, the model positions itself with the corresponding geometry.
<br>
The methodology to build and control the models is detailed at
<b><center>
<a href="http://www.ill.eu/?id=11830">ILL/Computing for Science/Virtual instruments/LEGO</a>
</center></b>
were you will learn:
<ul>
<li>the LEGO parts required, and how to order them</li>
<li>the building of the LEGO models</li>
<li>the Ubuntu computer to be configured (using <b>t2n</b> and <b>nbc</b>)</li>
<li>the control programs to load in the NXT</li>
<li>the McStas components to use in order to communicate with the LEGO model.</li>

July 26th, 2011: McStas 1.12c on Mac OS X Lion - new DMG added to
download section.
</h3>
<p>A new DMG for Mac OS X 10.7 Lion has been put together and can be
found in the <a href="/download">download</a> section. 
<p>Note that to enable multi-core / parallel simulations, you need to
compile <a
href="http://www.open-mpi.org/software/ompi/v1.4/">openmpi</a>
yourself before installing McStas, since it is not provided by Apple
on Lion. Alternatively you can perhaps get it via <a
href="http://www.macports">MacPorts</a>.
<p>The DMG should also work on Snow Leopard - but all software on the DMG
  must be reinstalled if McStas was previously installed.

<h3>
July 24th, 2011: McStas 1.12c on Mac OS X Lion - hold your horses!
</h3>
<p>The newly released Mac OS X 10.7 Lion includes a lot of nice
upgrades from Apple - including some that break the tool-layer and
mpi support for McStas:
<p>
<table border="1" width="60%">
  <tr><td><strong>Symptom</strong></td><td><strong>Cause</strong></td></tr>
  <tr><td>mpi compile fails</td>
  <td>The system-provided mpi is not detected by the McStas configure
    script</td></tr>
  <tr><td>mcgui does not start</td>
  <td>mcgui requires perl::Tk, and the version we ship with McStas
      1.12c explicitly requires perl 5.8, which has been removed from
      Lion</td></tr>
  <tr><td>mcplot does not plot</td>
  <td>For plotting, we rely on the SciKarl port of pgplot, perl::PDL
    and perl::PGPLOT. The SciKarl perl modules are built for perl 5.8
    which has been removed from Lion</td></tr>
</table>
<p>In conclusion: If you want to keep a functional McStas install,
please do not upgrade to Lion yet!

<h3 style="text-align: left;">June 11th, 2011: <span style="font-style: italic;">iFit, </span>a new Matlab tool to run, scan and optimize McStas simulations</h3>
<div style="text-align: left;">The new <a href="http://ifit.mccode.org">iFit</a>
tool is currently being developed. Among its general data analysis
features (load, do math, save, plot, ...), it may import McStas data
sets, perform simulations, including scans (even multidimensional), and
optimize simulation parameters (maximize or minimize a criteria which
can be defined by the user).<br>
iFit can also be used for basically any data analysis and reduction. It supports a very <a href="http://ifit.mccode.org/iFiles.html">large data format list </a>(including <span style="font-style: italic;">any</span> text based file), works with any dimensionality data, and provides powerful <a href="http://ifit.mccode.org/iOptim.html">optimization</a> and <a href="http://ifit.mccode.org/Fit.html">fitting</a> methods.<br>
<br>
You can learn more and get the iFit package at &lt;<a href="http://ifit.mccode.org">ifit.mccode.org</a>&gt; (requires Matlab to be installed). The <a href="http://ifit.mccode.org/McStas.html">iFit/McStas</a> help page is also available.<br>

June 3rd, 2011: McStas 1.12c re-released!
</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, the McStas 1.12c release from May 24th contained a
series of bugs, primarily in source components, related to a
type-change of the neutron counter.
</p><p>We have decided that since only a limited number of people have
downloaded the release, we will simply re-release McStas 1.12c with the
above bugs fixed.
</p><p>If you already downloaded and installed the packages released on
May 24th, please re-download and reinstall the fresh 1.12c packages from our <a href="/download">download</a> page.

</p><p>A complete liste of changes is available in the <a href="/download/src/CHANGES">CHANGES</a> document.

</p><p>Sorry for the inconvenience and best regards from the McStas team.

<h3>
May 24th, 2011: McStas 1.12c released!
</h3>
<p>A reasonably serious bug in our rectangular focusing routine was
identified by several McStas users and has now been corrected. We felt
that this warranted an update of the stable McStas release, meaning a
new 1.12c release.
</p><p>The 1.12c release is available now from our <a href="/download">download</a> page.

</p><p>A complete liste of changes is available in the <a href="/download/src/CHANGES">CHANGES</a> document.

</p><p>For those of you looking forward to the 2.0 release, all
required new functionality has been implemented, but documentation is
still lacking. The 2.0 release will become officially available once
the documentation has been updated, hopefully fall 2011.

Tips and tricks for running McStas on Windows systems
</h3>
<p>Recently, a new McStas user has (rightfully) pointed out that some
<i>annoyances</i> when running McStas on Windows have not been
properly documentd. The list below is a first attempt to remedy that
fact.
</p><p>
</p><ul>
  <li>Ideally, your user should be a local admin of Windows.
  </li><li>On
windows, to run a simulation, the "run" button in mcgui needs to be
clicked twice - once for compilation and second for actually running. </li><li>The resulting "perl" windows should be closed - put an "enter"
  character in them and they will close once finished. (Otherwise they
  will drain resources from your machine). The same strategy should be
  applied when visualizing data, either using the "3d/trace" mode or
  when pressing 'plot'.
  </li><li>It can cause problems to run mcgui from directories containing
  spaces, e.g. c:\Documents and Settings\User. Our suggestion is to
  instead create a work dir e.g. c:\McStasWork for your work. Simply
  save your instrumentfile there and re-open using mcgui.
</li></ul>
<p>The hope is that a new set of tools will be available in the McStas
2.x series of releases - but likely there will be at least a McStas
1.12c before this.
