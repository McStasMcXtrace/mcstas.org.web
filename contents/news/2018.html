<p><strong>Fixes of issues from last release: </strong>
<br>A number of issues from 2.4.1 were corrected, see the relevant
  GitHub issues for details: <a href="https://github.com/McStasMcXtrace/McCode/issues?&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3A%22McStas+2.4.1%22+">https://github.com/McStasMcXtrace/McCode/issues?&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3A%22McStas+2.4.1%22+</a>

<p><strong>Plus lots of work in general: </strong>
<br><a href="https://github.com/McStasMcXtrace/McCode/issues?&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed++project%3AMcStasMcXtrace%2FMcCode%2F1+">https://github.com/McStasMcXtrace/McCode/issues?&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed++project%3AMcStasMcXtrace%2FMcCode%2F1+</a>

<p><strong>Tools: </strong>
<ul>
  <li>As for the earlier few releases the default set of tools are Python-based and developed by Jakob Garde, DTU. 
  <ul>
    <li>The Perl ones are still around as a backup solution, handy for those that prefer "the oldschool way"
    <li>See <a href="https://github.com/McStasMcXtrace/McCode/wiki/User-documentation-for-the-2017--Python-tool-set">https://github.com/McStasMcXtrace/McCode/wiki/User-documentation-for-the-2017--Python-tool-set</a> for usage
    <li>On Unix platforms, the Perl tools are accessible by adding .pl to the wanted tool (mcgui.pl etc.)
    <li>On Windows, the Perl tools are accessible by adding -pl to the
    wanted tool (mcgui-pl etc.)
  </ul>
  <li>BUT: Please use the Python tools and provide feedback rather than sticking with the Perl! :-)
  <li>Feature developments:
  <ul>
   <li>mcgui: For a quick visualisation of your instrument, simply useSimulation -> Display-2D and Display-3D (will use the default instrument parameters)
    <li>mcgui: The run-dialogue now gives quick access to all mcdisplay and mcplot utilities as comboboxes
    <li>mcdoc: We now provide a mcdoc utility based on Python
  </ul>
</ul>

<p><strong>Platforms: </strong>
<ul>
  <li>Our Windows release is finally 64bit. Also further prepackages GSL for use e.g. with Multilayer_sample.comp from
   R. Dalgliesh (ISIS)
  <li>If you want to use NeXus and / or MPI on Windows, please ensure to install Strawberry perl!
</ul>

<p><strong>Libraries: </strong>
<ul>
  <li>NCrystal library from T. Kittelmann (ESS) and X.X. Cai (DTU Nutech/ESS) is distributed with McStas on Unix
  platforms. To use it, carry out the below steps:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>!!! To enable ncrystal with McStas on Linux systems
    please: </strong>
    <ul>
      <li>install the mcstas-ncrystal-2.5 package
      <li>(re-)install the mcstas-tools-python-mcrun-2.5 package
    </ul>
      
    <li>mcstas:~/NCryst$ mcstas-2.5-environment 
    <li>mcstas:~/NCryst$ source $MCSTAS/ncrystal/setup.sh
    <li>mcstas:~/NCryst$ ncrystal_preparemcstasdir 
    <li>mcstas:~/NCryst$ cp $MCSTAS/examples/NCrystal_example_mcstas.instr .
    <li>mcstas:~/NCryst$ mcrun -c NCrystal_example_mcstas.instr
  </ul>
  <li>MCPL library from the same authors now included at v. 1.2.3
</ul>

<p><strong>Components: </strong>
<ul>
<li>Single_crystal_inelastic.comp is a development from Duc Le (ISIS) and presents our attempt at a general,
   inelastic single crystal component. iFit can be used to generate its input, see
   <a href="http://ifit.mccode.org/McStas.html#mozTocId36233">http://ifit.mccode.org/McStas.html#mozTocId36233</a>
<li>E_4PI.comp is a monitor also from Duc Le, used to illustrate the output of his inelastic component in the
   instrument Test_Single_crystal_inelastic.instr
<li>Magnon_bcc.comp is new inelastic component from K. Lefmann (KU), used in Test_Magnon_bcc_TAS.instr and
   Test_Magnon_bcc_2D.instr 
<li>Isotropic_Sqw.comp from E. Farhi has recieved a number of important edits, including correctiono of a bug
   found by S. Bellissmia (CNR) relating to detailed balance
<li>PowderN received a bugfix from M. Bertelsen (KU) and a set of focusing patches from J. Saroun (NPI)
<li>NPI_tof_dhkl_detector.comp and NPI_tof_theta_monitor.comp are new monitor components from J. Saroun (NPI),
   used in his model of the ESS BEER instrument, see below
<li>Guide_multichannel.comp is a new component from J. Saroun (NPI), based on Guide_channeled.comp. It allows to
   simulate bi-spectral extraction optics.
<li>Sqq_w_monitor.comp is a development from P. Willendrup (DTU) and is a "scattering plane" monitor that outputs
   a set of energy-slices over a (qh,qk) reciprocal space plane, used in Test_Magnon_bcc_2D.instr
<li>Pol_guide_mirror.comp is a development from E. Knudsen (DTU) which among other use cases allows to simulate a
   so-called "frame overlap mirror" as envisioned for multiple ESS instruments
<li>Pol_Bfield.comp from E. Knudsen (DTU) has been updated to allow more flexible geometry and "rotatable" tabulated
   field descriptions. It replaces Pol_simpleBfield which is now in obsolete.
<li>Absorber.comp received a bugfix thanks  to Artur Glavic (PSI)
<li>FermiChopper.comp had a long-standing issue when using supermirror coatings in the slit-package which is
   now fixed, thanks to Ryoichi Kajimoto (J-PARC) 
<li>All monitors can now suppress file-output when their standard input parameter "nowritefile" is true. The idea
   is to be able to suppress (some) output at runtime, e.g. in simulations with lots of monitors.
</ul>

<p><strong>Instruments: </strong>
<ul>
<li>ESS_Testbeamline_HZB_V20.instr from Alaa Al-Falahat and Robin Woracek (ESS/HZB) is a model of the ESS test-
   beamline in Berlin

November 6th, 2018: McStas user survey 2018
</h3>
<p>Dear all,

<p>To assess the current use of McStas, we have put together the below survey for users of our neutron Monte Carlo ray-tracing package.

<p>Using the survey results, we hope to gain insight and statistics on the McStas user community, where it is currently based, which operating systems and computing infrastructures are used, and to what satisfaction the package, support infrastructure and documentation is used. The survey should also give us a clear picture where to focus our future efforts.

<p>We hope you will help us by investing a few minutes in the survey:

<h3>
September 29th, 2018: Release 2.4.1 works OK on macOS 10.14 Mojave
</h3>
Dear all,

<p>I can confirm that the latest McStas works fine on the newest macOS
release, even though the distributed "Check-PL-dependencies" script will report
both 10.13 and 10.14 as an unsupported macOS releases.

<p>If you need to install our Perl-based tool chain on 10.13 High
Sierra or 10.14 Mojave, the easiest way is to download an updated version of the above script, get
it <a
href="https://github.com/McStasMcXtrace/McCode/blob/master/support/MacOSX/Check-dependencies/Check-PL-dependencies.command">from
our GitHub</a> (I will also put a copy alongside the existing .tgz for
download)
<p>If, after an <i>upgrade</i> to Mojave you get compilation issues
with the error message
<pre>mccode-r.h:39:18: fatal error: math.h: No such file or
directory</pre>
then please run the following commands in a terminal: <ul>
  <li><pre>xcode-select --install</pre> - to initiate
  installation of updated Xcode commandline tools
  <li><pre>sudo open
/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Packages/macOS_SDK_headers_for_macOS_10.14.pkg</pre>
  - to install the development headerfiles in the usual /usr/include
  location
</ul>

May 18th, 2018: MDANSE 2018
</h3>
<p>Does the combination of DFT or classical MD with McStas for modeling experimental data
sound interesting?
<p>If so, please consider participating in the <a
href="https://www.isis.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/MDANSE-2018.aspx">MDANSE
2018</a> event in Tenerife this fall. Registration closes on May 31st 2018.

April 30th, 2018: Release 2.4.1 works OK on Ubuntu 18.04 + a workaround
</h3>
Dear all,

<p>I have tested McStas 2.4.1 with the recent <a href="http://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04/">Ubuntu 18.04 LTS "bionic
beaver"</a>, and <a href="/download/install_linux/">the usual installation recipe</a> works.

<p>The only found issue so far relates to the behaviour of the
Perl+PGPLOT <b><tt>mcplot.pl</tt></b> plotter which out of the box fails
with the error message: "<tt>%giza - ERROR - giza_open_device: Unknown
device, device not opened</tt>" (see below graphics also).
<p><a target=_blank href="/pics/mcplot-giza-bug.png"><img width=300 src="/pics/mcplot-giza-bug.png"></a>
<br>(In fact the problem was known already for Debian testing, see our related <a
href="https://github.com/McStasMcXtrace/McCode/issues/558">GitHub issue</a>)

<p>The following solutions/workarounds exist:
<ol>
  <li><b>Recommended:</b><br> Use the Python-based pyqtgraph plotter
  instead, i.e. <tt>mcplot</tt> (or <tt>mcplot-pyqtgraph</tt>). This
  would give you graphics like this:<br>
  <a target=_blank href="/pics/mcplot-use-pyqtgraph.png"><img width=300 src="/pics/mcplot-use-pyqtgraph.png"></a>
  <li><b>Configure pgplot/giza for "XWIN" driver:</b><br> Either edit your
  <tt>/usr/share/mcstas/2.4.1/tools/Perl/perl/mccode_config.perl</tt>
  replacing <tt>XSERV</tt> with <tt>XWIN</tt> or set the related
  environment variable in the shell, i.e.<br>
  <tt>export PGPLOT_DEV=/XWIN</tt><br>
  The solution will give you this appearance:<br>
  <a target=_blank href="/pics/mcplot-giza-XWIN.png"><img width=300 src="/pics/mcplot-giza-XWIN.png"></a>
  <li>
  <li><b>Force-configure to use the legacy PGPLOT:</b>
  <br>Use these
  commands in a shell and get your "normal" PGPLOT window back 
  <ul>
    <tt>
    <li>cd /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu
    <li>sudo ln -sf ../libpgplot.so libpgplot.so.0
    <li>sudo ln -sf ../libcpgplot.so libcpgplot.so.0
    </tt>
  </ul>
  The solution will give you this appearance (as usual):<br>

</h3>
<p>As some of you may have already seen via our <a
href="https://www.facebook.com/McStas/">facebook page</a> or on <a href="https://twitter.com/pwillendrup/status/972037990792028161">twitter</a>, a joint
McStas-McXtrace team visited the <a
href="https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/calendar/2018-gpu-hackathons/">2018
GPU Hackathon in Dresden</a> in March.
<p> We can not a such claim that the software <i>fully runs</i> on
NVIDIA GPU's, but we certainly gained knowledge and will investigate
further. :-)
<p>The team pariticpating in Dresden were
<ul>
  <li>DTU: Peter Willendrup, Jakob Garde, DTU Physics and Giovanni Fevola, DTU Energy
  <li>ILL: Emmannuel Farhi, ILL Spectroscopy Group / Computing for
  Science
  <li>UCPH: Mads Bertelsen, Niels Bohr Institute
</ul>
<p>Here is a few photos from the event - and also a <a href="http://media.mcstas.org/Dresden-GPU-hackathon-2018/McStas_McXtrace_final.pdf">PDF from
the final presentation</a>, put together by Mads Bertelsen,
University of Copenhagen<br>
