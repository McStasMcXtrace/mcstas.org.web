<h1>
McStas news items in 1998</h1>

<h2>
(Dec. 2 1998) Web page updates</h2>
The <a href="components/">component library documentation</a> has been
updated so that it reflects the McStas v1.0 release (all test results are
still for an old pre-release version though).
<p>A <a href="known-bugs.html">list of known bugs</a> in McStas has been
added; you might want to check this if you experience strange problems.&nbsp;
<hr>
<h2>
McStas v1.01 BETA 1</h2>
A <a href="support/beta/1.01b1.html">BETA release of McStas</a>, version
1.01 BETA 1, has been made available. This fixes some problems that have
come up since the first release (v1.0). The main change is the addition
of support for 32-bit Windows operating systems.
<p><i>You do not need to upgrade unless you experience some of the
<a href="support/beta/1.01b1.html#changes">specific
problems</a> that are addressed by this release.</i>
<hr>
<h2>
Mailing list</h2>
A <a href="http://neutron.risoe.dk/neutron-mc/">mailing list</a> for the
discussion of Monte Carlo simulation of neutron scattering has been set
up. The list is archived, and it is possible to search old messages.&nbsp;
<hr>
<h2>
Windows version of McStas</h2>
McStas has been successfully compiled and run on Windows (32 bit only).
It has not yet been fully tested. The <tt><a href="support/misc/mcstas.exe">.exe</a></tt>
file is available for download. To make it possible for the McStas compiler
to find the components, the component files (<tt>*.comp</tt>) must be placed
in
<tt>C:\mcstas\lib</tt>, or the <tt>MCSTAS</tt> environment variable
must be set to the name of the directory containing the files.&nbsp;

<h2>
MC workshop at Ris&oslash;</h2>
The <a href="http://www.risoe.dk/fys/Neutrons/rtd.htm#Workshop on Monte-Carlo simulation of neutron spectrometers">MC
workshop</a> at Ris&oslash; was very successfull in bringing together researchers
doing simulation of neutron scattering instruments. Manuals and CD-roms
of McStas were handed out to the participants.
<p>The <a href="Draft_standards.pdf">American draft standard</a> for writing
components which was mentioned on the workshop has been made available.
<p>Update: A nice color cover for the McStas CD-rom is now available, in
<a href="cover.ps">postscript</a> (<tt>.ps</tt>, 2.27 Mb) and <a href="cover.ps.gz">compressed
postscript</a> (<tt>.ps.gz</tt>, 226 Kb) formats.&nbsp;

<h2>
