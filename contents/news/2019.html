<h2>December 19th, 2019: Seasons greetings, McStas news and call for contributions</h2>
<p>Dear all,

<p>This is to inform you all that the next stable McStas release 2.6 will become available during January 2020.<br>
<br>- If you have any useful contributions to make, in the shape of instruments or components, now would be a good time. :-)

<p>I would also like to mention that we aim to make an official beta-release of our experimental McStas 3.0 available soon. This will happen following v. 2.6 within the first months of the new year, and be the first release to support running <strong>simulations on Nvidia GPU processors</strong>. Probably not all of our components will be ported at release, but most of what you do on CPUs today will be available!

<p>A short set of slides is available <a href="http://www.mcstas.org/news/Porting_McStas_to_GPU_via_OpenACC.pdf">here</a> outlining what is coming, when we started and how we achieved it... :-)

<p>Seasons greetings on behalf of the McStas team,
<br><br>
Peter Willendrup

<h2>October 11th, 2019: Respin of McStas v2.5 to support macOS Mojave
and Catalina</h2>
Recently one of our users reported issues on macOS Mojave with mcgui
not picking up the right location of the mcstas library, please <a href="https://github.com/McStasMcXtrace/McCode/issues/868">see
the related GitHub issue</a> for more information.
<p>Since the problem seems to occur consistently on updated Mojave
(10.14) and Catalina (10.15) systems, a patched version of our macOS
App bundle has been uploaded to <a
href="http://download.mcstas.org/current/mac">our download page</a>.
<p>Please let us know via <a href="mailto:mcstas-users@mcstas.org">the
mailinglist</a> or by <a href="https://github.com/McStasMcXtrace/McCode/issues/">creating a GitHub ticket</a> if any further issues arise.

<h2>June 16th, 2019: Statistics on the history of McStas releases</h2>
<p>Did you ever wonder how the number of included components and instrument files in McStas changed over time? - And did you know that we now include 215 components and 192 example instruments?

<p>The figure below is generated from release-metadata extracted from
<a href="http://download.mcstas.org">http://download.mcstas.org</a>,
where all McStas releases can be found.

<h2>June 7th, 2019: math.h issues on macOS 10.14.5 Mojave</h2>
<p>With the latest update to Xcode command line tools on macOS, there is no longer an option to install the system header files to the legacy location of /usr/include .

<p>This unfortunately means that the miniconda-based gcc that we
distribute with McStas (and set up by default) is no longer able to locate the math.h header file and compilations fail with
<pre>
mccode-r.h:39:18: fatal error: math.h: No such file or directory
</pre>

<p>Our suggested workaround is to configure your McStas installation
to instead use the system-provided clang compiler, see <a href="https://github.com/McStasMcXtrace/McCode/issues/799">our GitHub
issue #799</a> for a detailed description of how to do this.

<h2>March 25th-20th, 2019: McStas School at CSNS</h2>
<p>Dear all,
<p>In collaboration with the <a href="http://english.ihep.cas.cn/csns/">China Spallation Neutron
Source</a>, the McStas team participated in the first ever <a href="http://csns2019.mcstas.org">McStas
school in China</a> in the last week of March.
<p><img src="http://csns2019.mcstas.org/logo-left.png"><img width="3.5%" src="http://csns2019.mcstas.org/DTU.png"> <img width="10%" src="http://csns2019.mcstas.org/ESS.png"> <img src="http://csns2019.mcstas.org/csns_logo.png">
<p>All lecture material and exercises are available through our new
<a href="https://github.com/McStasMcXtrace/Schools/tree/master/CSNS_March_2019">McStas school site, hosted on GitHub</a>
<p>Further, our hosts suggested we <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLodvBRHVfJ9HjquUVlyXtLjvVB3x67_p7">recorded videos of the lectures</a>
which are slowly becoming available on the new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLodvBRHVfJ9HjquUVlyXtLjvVB3x67_p7">McStas youtube channel</a>.

<h2>January 18th, 2019: McStas survey results</h2>
<p>Dear all,
<p>The results from the 2018 McStas user survey are now online at <a href="http://survey2018.mcstas.org">http://survey2018.mcstas.org</a>.
<p>
<a href="http://survey2018.mcstas.org"><img border="1" height=200
src="http://survey2018.mcstas.org/results/Q1.png"><img border="1" height=200
src="http://survey2018.mcstas.org/results/Q3.png"><img border="1" height=200 src="http://survey2018.mcstas.org/results/Q5.png"></a>
<p>The main conclusions are that
<ul>
    <li>Q1: McStas users tend to upgrade to the latest release.
    <li>Q2: Linux is by a large margin the most used platform, followed by Windows 10 and macOS.
    <li>Q3: McStas are generally happy about the installation and use of the package. Very few people have issues with installation.
    <li>Q4: The most used tool set is the default Python version, default since v. 2.1.
    <li>Q5: McStas users seem very satisfied with the user support.
    <li>Q6: McStas users tend to trust McStas to large extent. <b>But please don't trust it blindly!!</b>
    <li>Q7: McStas users mostly compare with experimental data or  analytic / back of envelope calculations.
    <li>Q8: McStas users have widespread knowledge of all documentation resources - but we should probably disseminate the wiki further.
    <li>Q9: The individual suggestions/questions/comments/... will be answered through individual <a href="https://github.com/McStasMcXtrace/McCode/labels/2018%20survey">GitHub issues</a>.
    <li>Q10: McStas is used on all continents that have / are planning neutron scattering infrastructure. Users are mostly based at these facilities, but also at other research labs or universities.
</ul>
Thank you very much for the (generally) very positive review - also,
you are more than welcome to participate in continuing debate on user
suggestions that will take place in the individual <a
href="https://github.com/McStasMcXtrace/McCode/labels/2018%20survey">GitHub
survey issues</a>.
