<h3>
September 3rd, 2013: Workaround for installing McStas on Windows without an
active internet connection
</h3>
<p>What is not completely clear from the McStas install docs is that
on the Windows platform, an active internet connection is required during
installation.
<p>To work around this, perform these steps <b>before
installing McStas itself</b>:
<ul>
  <li>Download and install a <b>Strawberry Perl 5.16</b> for your system from <a
  href="http://strawberryperl.com">http://strawberryperl.com</a>
  <li>Download <a href="http://ppds.mccode.org/ZipPackage/PPDs.zip">this zip file</a> (rightclik, save as)
  <li>Unzip the Zip file and using a command window, cd to the folder
  <li>Run the enclosed <pre>postsetup.bat</pre>
</ul>
After these steps, install the McStas packages in this order:
<ul>
  <li>McStas core package (mcstas-NSIS-2.0-*.exe)
  <li>McStas component package (mcstas-comps-NSIS-2.0-*.exe)
  <li>McStas Perl tool package (mcstas-tools-perl-NSIS-2.0-*.exe)
  <li>- then the optional Python packages if wanted
</ul>
Once everything is installed, use the new links on your desktop for either starting mcgui directly or starting a "mcstas environment shell" with mcrun, mcplot, mcgui etc.

July 4th, 2013: Joint Vitess and McStas School and Workshop in Berlin, September 18th-20th
</h3>
<p>Dear simulators!
<p>The joint Vitess and McStas teams are planning a common simulation school and workshop this fall - scheduled for 
<p><b>September 18th-20th in the Berlin area.</b>
<p>A rough program of the three-day school is:
<ul>
  <li>Day 1: Introduction and tutorials for the two packages, intended mainly for new users. Hands-on exercises.
  <li>Day 2: Advanced features demonstrated by examples and talks. Hands-on exercises.
  <li>Day 3: Users have an option to present their own work, give feedback and suggestions for new features.
</ul>
To have an estimate of the number of participants, please send us a
short email to <a href="mailto:vitess@helmholtz-berlin.de">vitess@helmholtz-berlin.de</a> indicating this, preferably before the end of July. If you are already experienced with the packages and hence would like to skip the first day, please also indicate this.

<p>Sending us the email does not oblige you to participate. :-)

<p>All the best from the combined Vitess and McStas teams!

<h3>
May 2nd, 2013: Updated ESS source components for McStas 1.12c and 2.0
</h3>
<p>An set of updated ESS source components for use with McStas 1.12c and
2.0 have been put in the <a href="/download/share/">download
share</a>.
<p>The <a href="/download/share/ESS_source_20130502.zip">zip archive</a> includes the following:
<ol>
<li>Updated ESS source components for McStas 1.12c and 2.0 with
  <ul>
    <li> Cold and thermal moderators
    <li> Cylindrical cold source geometry
    <li> Flat thermal wing geometry
    <li> Geometry close to that from MCNPX
    <li> 2012 cold brightness
    <li> A much easier-to-use definition of geometry, allowing to
    specify the instrument position within a 60-degree sector
    <li> A couple of bug fixes
  </ul>
<li>Updated Brilliance_monitor.comp for McStas 1.12c and 2.0
<li>ESS_moderator_long_2001.comp for McStas 1.12c (same as included in McStas 2.0)
<li>Test instruments set up for estimating the (cold) source brilliance of ESS in 2012 and 2001 versions
<li>PDF plots of average and peak brilliance as produced by the new McStas 
   source, overlayed on the officialcurve from ESS target division and 
   the corresponding curve from VitESS.
</ol>
<p>We hope to soon release McStas either a 2.0a or 2.1 which will include 
these as well as other improvements.
<hr>
<h3>
April 6th, 2013: Ubuntu-based Live-DVD with McStas 2.0, 1.12c and iFit available
</h3>
An updated Ubuntu Live-dvd is available on the <a
href="/ubuntu">Ubuntu</a> page. It includes:
<ul>
  <li>McStas 2.0 and all needed dependencies for Perl- and
  Python-based tools
  <li>McStas 1.12c and all needed dependencies
  <li>iFit 1.3.1

McStas in a virtual machine or as an easy way of evaluating
differences between 1.12c and 2.0.
<hr>
<h3>
March 21st, 2013: Supplemental mcdisplay / Python package available
</h3>
As of today, our Python-based mcdisplay package is available via
either
<ul>
  <li>apt-get install mcstas-tools-python-mcdisplay-2.0 on debian-like systems (if you added our .deb
  repository)
  <li>yum install mcstas-tools-python-mcdisplay-2.0 (if you added our .rpm repository)
  <li>- Or for manual download from our <a href="/download/share">Download
  share</a>
</ul>
<p>To make use of the package, you need an x3d browser on your system -
we recommend <a href="http://www.instantreality.org"
target=_blank>Instant Player</a> developed by the Fraunhofer
Gesellschaft.
<p>If you want to run a combination of our Python and Perl tools - have a
look at File->Preferences in mcgui (see graphic below)

<p>The allows you to define the commands executed from
mcgui for running/compiling (mcrun), visualizing (mcdisplay) or
plotting data (mcplot) from your instrument. The naming convention is
this one (not completely obvious, sorry):
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="mcgui-2.0-prefs.png"></td>
    <td>
      <p>Unix (Linux / Mac OS):
      <table border=1>
	<tr><td>Tool</td><td>Perl</td><td>Python</td></tr>
	<tr><td>mcrun</td><td>mcrun-2.0</td><td>mcrun-2.0-py</td></tr>
	<tr><td>mcplot</td><td>mcplot-2.0</td><td>mcplot-2.0-py (chaco)
	  or mcplot-2.0-matplotlib (matplotlib)</td></tr>
	<tr><td>mcdisplay</td><td>mcdisplay-2.0</td><td>mcdisplay-2.0-py</td></tr>
      </table>
      <p>Windows:
      <table border=1>
	<tr><td>Tool</td><td>Perl</td><td>Python</td></tr>
	<tr><td>mcrun</td><td>mcrun.pl</td><td>mcrun-py.bat</td></tr>
	<tr><td>mcplot</td><td>mcplot.pl</td><td>mcplot-chaco.bat (chaco)
	  or mcplot-matplotlib.bat (matplotlib)</td></tr>
       <tr><td>mcdisplay</td><td>mcdisplay.pl</td><td>mcdisplay-py.bat</td></tr>
      </table>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>To save your preferences for the next McStas run, use File->Save
configuration:
<ul>
  <li>On Unix (Linux / Mac OS) systems to your user's $HOME/.mcstas/
  folder
  <li>On Windows directly to the system
  c:\mcstas-2.0\lib\mcstas-tools-2.0\perl folder
  </ul>

<h3>
March 15th, 2013: (Re-)enable syntax highlighting in mcgui-2.0 on Ubuntu
</h3>
If your mcgui editor on Ubuntu is missing it's usual syntax
highlighting, either
<ul>
  <li>If you installed mcstas via our Debian repository, simply run
  this command in a terminal:
  <pre>sudo apt-get install libtk-codetext-perl</pre>
  <li>If you installed mcstas "manually" by downloading our set of <a
  href="/download">Debian packags from the download page</a>, first
  download our <a
  href="http://packages.mccode.org/debian/dists/stable/main/binary-amd64/libtk-codetext-perl_0.3.4-1_all.deb"
  target=_blank>64 bit</a> or <a
  href="http://packages.mccode.org/debian/dists/stable/main/binary-i386/libtk-codetext-perl_0.3.4-1_all.deb"
  target=_blank>32 bit</a> libtk-codetext-perl package. Secondly
  install it using<pre>sudo dpkg -i libtk-codetext-perl_0.3.4-1_all.deb</a>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>
March 15th, 2013: <a href="/download/components/">Component docs</a>
are back on website, plus an mcdoc hint
</h3>
As several people have pointed out, the component docs were removed from the website in connection with the release of McStas 2.0.

<p>They are now back at <a href="/download/components/s">http://www.mcstas.org/download/components/</a>

<p>I have further become aware that the McStas 2.0 distribution - at least in the debian packages - was missing a call to mcdoc for generating the same pages there

<p>To remedy that problem, please:

<pre>
cd /usr/local/lib/mcstas-2.0
sudo mcdoc -t
</pre>
- which should bring back the docs on your local machine.

<p>I am working my way down a list of other annoyances and aim to release a McStas 2.0a with various issues fixed in a few weeks. Please let me know if you found any issue that I can correct in the next release.

<h3>
March 6th, 2013: Building McStas 2.0 (and the dev-tree) from source
code using <a href="http://cmake.org/" target="_blank">CMake</a>
</h3>
Several people have reported difficulties in configuring / building /
installing McStas 2.0 from source code. Below you can find some
information and hints on building McStas this way.
<p>
<ul>
  <li>The configure scripts in the McStas 2.0 packages are partly
  broken, they will <strong>NOT</strong> give you a proper build of McStas.
  <li>We have made a transition to the <a href="http://cmake.org/"
  target="_blank">CMake</a> build system, and it turns out that <strong>you
  need a CMake > 2.8 for building McStas!</strong>
  <li>Should you not have a recent enough <a href="http://cmake.org/"
  target="_blank">CMake</a>, you can easily build a new <a
  href="http://cmake.org/" target="_blank">CMake</a> one from
  source-code using:
  <ul>
    <li>To install Cmake in the default location run
    <pre>./bootstrap</pre> If you need to install somewhere else run
    <pre>./bootstrap --prefix=/somewhere/else</pre>
    <li>Next run <pre>make</pre>to build and<pre>make install</pre>to install
    CMake 2.8 or later.
  </ul>
  <p><li><strong>Once you have a CMake > 2.8</strong> you can build each
  of the provided McStas source packages using e.g.
  <ul>
    <li><pre>tar xzf mcstas-2.0-src.tar.gz</pre>
    <li><pre>cd mcstas-2.0-src</pre>
    <li><pre>mkdir build && cd build</pre>
    <li>To install in /usr/local as usual use<pre>cmake ..</pre> -
    otherwise use <pre>cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/somewhere/else ..</pre>
    <li>Afterwards perform <pre>make</pre> and <pre>make install</pre>
    as usual
  </ul>
  <p><li>The build steps above as minimum need to be performed for the
  packages
  <ul>
    <li><pre>mcstas-2.0-src.tar.gz and mcstas-comps-2.0-src.tar.gz</pre>
  </ul>
  <li>For the legacy set of Perl tools you will need to build
  <ul>
    <li><pre>mcstas-tools-perl-2.0-src.tar.gz</pre>
  </ul>
  <li>For the supplementary set of Python tools you will need to build
  <ul>
    <li><pre>mcstas-tools-python-mcrun-2.0-src.tar.gz and either
mcstas-tools-python-mcplot-chaco-2.0-src.tar.gz or mcstas-tools-python-mcplot-matplotlib-2.0-src.tar.gz</pre>
  </ul>
</ul>
<strong>TIP:</strong> The complete set of sources for building McStas 2.0 can be downloaded by the
command
<pre>svn co https://svn.mccode.org/svn/McCode/tags/mcstas-2.0</pre>
instead of downloading the tar.gz's from <a href="/download">the
download page</a>. Afterwards, use one or more of the
<pre>build_...</pre> scripts downloaded to the top level to build your
own local version of McStas 2.0.
<p>Should you ever want to build our current development version, check
it out from our SVN at https://svn.mccode.org/svn/McCode/trunk and have a
look at e.g. build_debs_mcstas in the top level. If you want a
non-standard installation-prefix, please do a <pre>export
MCINSTALL_PREFIX=/some/path/somewhere</pre> before running the build_
or mkdist scripts.

<h3>
January 4th, 2013: Experimental deb and rpm mirrors for McStas
</h3>
<p>As of today we provide package repositories for deb and rpm package
driven Linux systems. To allow automatic update of your mcstas, mcstas-components and
tools when new revisions are relased, follow these instructions:
<p> On Debian class systems (including Ubuntu, mint etc.):
  <pre>cd /etc/apt/sources.list.d
sudo wget http://packages.mccode.org/debian/mccode.list
sudo apt-get update
</pre>
<p> On RedHat class systems (including Scientific Linux, CentOS etc.):
  <pre>cd /etc/yum.repos.d
sudo wget http://packages.mccode.org/rpm/mccode.repo
sudo yum update
</pre>
<p>After following these steps your package manager should now be
  aware of mcstas (example from Debian)
  <pre>
mcstas@debian:~$ apt-cache search mcstas
<b>mcstas-2.0</b> - mcstas built using CMake
<b>mcstas-comps-2.0</b> - mcstas-comps built using CMake
<b><font color=blue>mcstas-suite</font></b> - A metapackage for McStas + perl and python tools
<b><font color=blue>mcstas-suite-perl</font></b> - A metapackage for McStas + perl tools
<b><font color=blue>mcstas-suite-python</font></b> - A metapackage for McStas + python tools
<b>mcstas-tools-2.0</b> - legacy-tools built using CMake
<b>mcstas-tools-python-mcplot-chaco-2.0</b> - python-tools-mcplot built using CMake
<b>mcstas-tools-python-mcplot-matplotlib-2.0</b> - python-tools-mcplot built using CMake
<b>mcstas-tools-python-mcrun-2.0</b> - python-tools-mcrun built using CMake
</pre>
<p>The new <font color=blue>meta-packages</font> mcstas-suite, mcstas-suite-perl and
mcstas-suite-python allows you to install mcstas with one or both sets
of tools (mcrun/mcplot etc.) by simple apt-get or yum commands like
<p>Debian:<pre>sudo apt-get install mcstas-suite</pre>
RedHat:<pre>sudo yum install mcstas-suite-perl</pre>
<p>Please report any trouble with the repositories to <a href="mailto:mcstas-users@mcstas.org">mcstas-users@mcstas.org</a>.
