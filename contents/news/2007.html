March 7th, 2007: NeXus/DANSE/MacOS X support in McStas 1.11
</h3>
The <a href="/about/contacts">McStas team</a> went to visit SNS, and took the opportunity to implement the NeXus support in collaboration with SNS staff. This will be in the 1.11 release coming out very soon. Work was also carried out to ease import of McStas within the <a href="http://wiki.cacr.caltech.edu/danse/index.php/Main_Page">DANSE</a> project. A MacOS X installation procedure will also be in the 1.11 (experimental). Full PGPLOT support will probably be included in the Windows installer as well.
