September 24th, 2008: McStas 1.12 Windows, bug and fix
</h3>
<p>McStas user Tom Chen has recently made the McStas team aware of a bug preventing him to do optimization from mcgui on Windows, which always selected --ncount=1e6. Further testing showed that both scans and --optim runs using both mcgui and mcrun were affected.

<p>Only Windows installations of McStas 1.12 are affected.

<p>To remedy the problem, please replace your c:\McStas\bin\mcrun.pl with <a href="http://cvs.mcstas.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/mcstas/mcrun.pl?revision=1.92&root=McStasStable">this version</a>.

<p>An updated version of McStas 1.12 with this and other fixes will be made available within a few weeks.

September 2nd, 2008: Looking forward at McStas 2.0
</h3>
<p>During a meeting this summer, the developer team agreed that time has come to release a new major release of McStas, leaving the 1.x series. As explained in the manual, a change in the major release number should only occur in case of loss of backward compatibility. The main areas where this will happen is:
<ul>
  <li>Component parameter naming convention. We have defined a common nomemclature for similar components, easing the process of interchanging components.
  <li>Polarisation. We are making serious progress in polarisation support, meaing that we will merge the existing STATE PARAMETERS (x,y,z,vx,vy,vz,t,s1,s2,p) and POLARISATION PARAMETERS (sx, sy, sz) to a new STATE PARAMETERS (x,y,z,vx,vy,vz,t,sx,sy,sz,p)
</ul>
<p>Since we have now defined that the next version will break (some) backward compatibilty, this list might extend slightly.
<p>McStas 1.12 will remain supported for one year after release of McStas 2.0, allowing users a calm transition period.
<p>Possibly a bugfix release of McStas 1.12 will appear during fall/winter of 2008.
<p>McStas 2.0 is planned for spring 2009
