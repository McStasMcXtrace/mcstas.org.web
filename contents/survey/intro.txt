McStas survey 2002

To make shure that the McStas project is relaunched with success, we
have decided to do a little survey among the McStas users, to enshure
that the opinions within the commmunity are reflected in the oncoming 
versions of the software.

For example, many users have indicated that the current setup of the
mcstas tools (e.g. mcrun, mcplot, etc.) is becoming very complicated
to install on some platforms. This will be dealt with in the next
release, on basis of the result of this survey.

Also, we would very much like to know what versions of McStas that the
user base is using and on which platforms the software runs.

The survey should only take a few minutes to complete, and is
available at http://mcstas.risoe.dk/survey . If you wish to enter
your data anonymously, this is possible.

We hope that you will find few minutes needed to complete the survey,
and thus help us in making McStas a better software.
