It is well known that the <a href="/">McStas</a> mailing list has not been functioning regularly since november 2001. Much effort is beeing made in restoring this much needed resource to the <a href="/">McStas</a> user community. It is likely that the new mailing list will be based on <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/mailman.html">mailman</a>, and brought to life before august 1st, 2002.
